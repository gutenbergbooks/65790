<br />THE MAN AND THE MONEY.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear Gilsey, I rather think I can land him
for you,&rdquo; declared Nick Carter, with an odd smile lurking
in the corners of his keen, gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that will not do, Nick,&rdquo; protested Mr. Raymond
Gilsey, with an immediate display of apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not do, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be what I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not what you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Nick,&rdquo; and Mr. Raymond Gilsey decisively
shook his head.</p>
<p>He was a venerable banker, with a remarkably gentle
and benevolent countenance. He was the president of
the Milmore Trust Company, a banking-institution located
in Forty-second Street, the patrons of which consisted
chiefly of business firms in the immediate neighborhood,
and of wealthy women, to whom the up-town
location of the bank was a convenience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>It was in Mr. Gilsey&rsquo;s handsome private office that Nick
Carter was seated, one afternoon early in May, in response
to a telephone request from the banker about an
hour before. Between the two there existed a friendship
of long standing, and the celebrated detective had hastened
to respond. As yet, however, he had received but
a hint at the business for which he had been called, and
he wondered a little at the banker&rsquo;s obvious misgivings,
as appeared in his remarks noted above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please explain, Mr. Gilsey,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Certainly,
if there is a deficit in your cash, and you suspect&mdash;&mdash; Ah,
but stop a moment. Perhaps it will be just as well, my
dear Gilsey, if our interview&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last, spoken with lowered voice, was considered
with a significant glance in the direction of Gilsey&rsquo;s
private stenographer, who sat busily engaged near one
of the office windows, and Nick&rsquo;s glance was equivalent
to a suggestion that the presence of a third party might
wisely be dispensed with.</p>
<p>This third party was a young woman named Belle
Braddon, apparently about twenty-five years of age. Certain
features about her, however, which Nick&rsquo;s keen eyes
were quick to notice, indicated that Miss Braddon was
in divers ways experienced beyond her years.</p>
<p>She was that type of girl quite properly termed dashing.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Her figure was striking, her face handsome, with
mobile red lips, alluring blue eyes, and cheeks with a soft
tinge of color not entirely their own. She had, too, an
unusual abundance of wavy auburn hair, which was then
arranged in picturesque disorder. Regarded from top
to toe, she was decidedly noticeable, and the style of girl
to which most men are quick to respond.</p>
<p>Nick Carter, however, did not quite fancy the general
appearance of Miss Braddon, and he abruptly decided
that her absence was desirable. In response to the cue
so quietly given him, the banker glanced at the girl, and
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you now at work on, Belle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Braddon started slightly, much as if her ears
had been deaf to any preceding remarks, then turned
with a gracious smile to her employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the quarterly reports which you dictated this
morning,&rdquo; she replied, with a peculiarly clear and penetrating
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may drop that for the present, Belle, as I may
change some of the concluding pages,&rdquo; said Mr. Gilsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are my letters ready for signing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may leave them on your table. As I shall be
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
engaged with this gentleman for some time, and will not
require you later, I will excuse you for the rest of the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, thank you very much, Mr. Gilsey,&rdquo; cried Miss
Braddon, beaming gratefully as she arose from her
table. &ldquo;That will be very nice, sir. I can do a little shopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker nodded and smiled, then reverted to Nick,
and conversed with him upon casual matters while the
girl prepared to go. Apparently, Nick did not notice
her, but he nevertheless saw all that was worth noting.</p>
<p>As Miss Braddon put on a broad picture hat and her
light wrap, her expression became more grave and her
cheeks lost some of their color.</p>
<p>Twice she glanced furtively at the detective, with a
certain resentful gleam in her pretty eyes. That it did not
entirely please her, despite her effusive thanks, was
evinced in the slight curl of her red lips; yet she presently
bowed politely and departed, gently closing the office
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An attractive girl, Gilsey, your stenographer,&rdquo; remarked
Nick carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Braddon?&rdquo; queried the banker, smiling complacently.
&ldquo;So she is, Nick, and as capable and charming
as she is showy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say showy,&rdquo; laughed Nick dryly. &ldquo;I said
attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much the same, Nick, when applied to a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she been long in your employ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, she came well recommended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly so,&rdquo; bowed Gilsey; then he added, with a
smile and headshake: &ldquo;You professional detectives are
habitually suspicious of everybody, I really believe.
That girl is all right, Nick, take my word for it. Her
uncle, with whom she lives, is one of our largest depositors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; smiled Nick, a bit oddly. &ldquo;Now, my dear
Gilsey, why have you sent for me? What can I do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker became grave in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two reasons, Nick, why I have appealed to
you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;First, because we are old friends, and
I know that you will do just what I require upon this
case, and no more than I require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your second reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know I can safely trust you, Nick, and
that you will give no publicity to the case after having
dropped it, providing your investigations warrant dropping
it. That is more than I could expect or hope for
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
from men of the central office, and so I have appealed
to you, relying upon our long friendship to influence
you to aid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick nodded gravely for a moment, noting the profound
anxiety now reflected in the banker&rsquo;s venerable
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will do what I can for you, Gilsey, and you
may depend upon me to be discreet,&rdquo; said he warmly.
&ldquo;Now, what is the trouble here? You intimated that a
deficit exists in your cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did, Nick, yet I am not sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems strange to you,&rdquo; replied Gilsey. &ldquo;I can
explain in a few words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cecil Kendall, one of my most trusty clerks, has
been absent on a vacation for several days. During the
illness of our cashier, Mr. Knights, for nearly three
months, Kendall has been doing double his share of work.
He has handled the cashier&rsquo;s end of our business, as well
as his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I follow you,&rdquo; said Nick attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own duties here are very arduous,&rdquo; continued
Gilsey, &ldquo;yet, as far as possible, I always keep an eye
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
upon the work of all of my clerks. Kendall, however,
is a man of unusual ability, an expert accountant, and a
man in whom I have had the greatest confidence. His
work on the books has always been satisfactory, yet
in doing double his ordinary duties it would not be
strange if some of his work had fallen a little behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; admitted Nick. &ldquo;Do you find that the
books are not in proper shape up to date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I cannot tell,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Kendall
went to Boston to attend the wedding of his brother
last Tuesday. He was to have returned this morning, but
has not yet appeared, nor sent me any word explaining
his absence. I am unable to tell in just what condition
he left his accounts. I know, however, that several large
amounts were received here during Monday, and also that
considerable was used for the payment of notes which
came due that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an exceedingly busy day for Mr. Kendall,&rdquo;
continued the banker, &ldquo;and he worked here Monday until
compelled to leave to catch a late train to Boston.
I went home at my usual hour, about four o&rsquo;clock, so did
not see him after he wound up his Monday work.
Whether he has left part of his work undone, depending
upon memoranda of which I am ignorant, I cannot
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
say. All I know, Nick, is that he has not returned to-day,
as expected, and that there appears to be a serious
deficit in the cash accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly ninety thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Serious, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the detective.
&ldquo;Have you no way of getting at the exact truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it can be done,&rdquo; replied Gilsey quickly. &ldquo;But
it would require time, and occasion a publicity which I
wish to prevent, for a day or two, at least, in the hope
that Kendall will return, or can be found, and show
that matters here are all right. In fact, Nick, I am inclined
to think they are, and that I am needlessly
alarmed; yet, for the protection of our depositors, I feel
that I must take some step at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite properly, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to locate Kendall as quickly as possible. I
want him here, that an explanation may be made. In
case I am entirely wrong, however, and no deficit really
exists, I do not wish Kendall to learn of my misgivings,
and that I have employed a detective, the injustice of
which would seriously and needlessly wound him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; admitted Nick thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
now see about what you want of me, Gilsey. You wish
me to locate Kendall as quickly as possible, and send
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
or bring him here without disclosing your doubts and
apprehensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is perfectly honest, as you are still inclined to
think, it should be an easy matter to locate him before
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy for one of your experience, Nick; and that is
precisely why I have called upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Kendall&rsquo;s Boston address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already wired to his Boston friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what result?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message in reply states that Kendall left for New
York last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it state by what route?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, he should have arrived here this morning,&rdquo;
remarked Nick, more gravely. &ldquo;There is a bare possibility,
Gilsey, that he is a victim of foul play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that, Nick, which also deters me
from acting too hastily, or making any immediate
charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know whether Kendall had much money with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he had what you fear may be missing, Mr. Gilsey,
he had a good, round sum,&rdquo; observed Nick dryly.</p>
<p>The banker shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot yet believe it,&rdquo; said he gravely. &ldquo;There are,
too, other parties whom I would spare the pain of knowing
that I have unjustly suspected Kendall of embezzlement,
and gone so far as to call in a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other parties, Gilsey?&rdquo; inquired Nick, with
brows lifting slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to Doctor Leonard Royal, of Fordham, the
Episcopal rector, and to his family,&rdquo; explained the banker.
&ldquo;I infer from what I see of the couple that Kendall is
engaged to marry the rector&rsquo;s daughter, Medora Royal.
He is, too, an intimate friend of young Harry Royal, the
rector&rsquo;s only son, who went to Boston with him. It happens,
Nick, that Doctor Royal and I have been lifelong
friends. I regard him as fondly as a brother. In case I
am wrong, Nick, I would not for the world have them
know that I suspect Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, my dear Gilsey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a nutshell, Nick, I wish you to locate him for me
as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not arrest him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant the banker hesitated, then said huskily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Nick, not that. Not&mdash;not unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, if any &lsquo;unless&rsquo; creeps in, I shall know what
to do without instructions,&rdquo; Nick bluntly interposed.
&ldquo;Now, Mr. Gilsey, give me Kendall&rsquo;s city address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He occupies bachelor&rsquo;s apartments in Fifty-ninth
Street. Here is the number. He has not been there to-day,
however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long since you sent to inquire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a clubman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter replaced his note-book in his pocket, then
arose and took his hat from the banker&rsquo;s table.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />WHERE TIDES MEET.</h2>
<p>Before making his departure, Nick again turned to the
banker and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question occurs to me, Gilsey. How did
you happen to discover that a deficit possibly exists in
your cash, and under the circumstances stated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&mdash;it was a perfectly natural discovery in the
course of to-day&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; Mr. Gilsey faltered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>A subtle gleam showed for a moment in Nick&rsquo;s keen
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of anything, or have you ever heard
anything, which at once led you to examine Kendall&rsquo;s
accounts when he failed to appear at his desk this morning?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>The banker hesitated for barely a second, and Nick
cried curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Gilsey, there is something more. Let
me have the whole business, all you know, or up go my
hands and I drop the case. I thought you knew I was a
man to be safely trusted, dear fellow. Come, come, what
sent you to Kendall&rsquo;s books so hurriedly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banker colored slightly, and now hastened to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Nick, to be perfectly frank with you, despite
that I give no credit to the statement, it was said to me
about two weeks ago that Kendall was given to
gambling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! Gambling, eh? Who said so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brother banker, Nick, whose name certainly is not
material at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? Anything more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked Kendall about it that very day, and he denied
the report and laughed it to scorn. I could not believe it
of him, Nick, and did not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did your brother banker say, Mr. Gilsey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely that he had seen both Kendall and young
Harry Royal one evening coming out of a gambling-house
said to be owned and run by one Moses Flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Moses Flood, eh?&rdquo; muttered Nick, with a
curious smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a mistake,&rdquo; continued Gilsey, with
augmented feeling. &ldquo;Kendall is not a man of evil inclinations.
It is not in his nature to have formed any
relations whatever with a scoundrel who gambles for a
living, and who runs a resort where&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop just a moment, Gilsey,&rdquo; interrupted Nick, with
an odd little laugh. &ldquo;A man of your limited experience
is very prone to misjudge men out of his own circle in
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this, my dear Gilsey,&rdquo; said Nick, more seriously.
&ldquo;I know Moses Flood even better than I know you. Understand
me, now, I do not advocate gambling, nor do I
defend him as a gambler, for such he certainly is, and
in that respect he is an outlaw and a man to be shunned.
I am opposed to gambling of all kinds, whether done with
cards, or in a pool-room, or on a race-track, or in the
stock exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly, Nick, I already know that,&rdquo; exclaimed
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Gilsey, with a surprised expression in his gentle, blue
eyes. &ldquo;But what do you imply of this rascal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely this,&rdquo; smiled Nick. &ldquo;Aside from his vocation,
which in every way I despise, Moses Flood is not a rascal.
I know what I am talking about, Gilsey. Flood is a man
whose word is as good as any man&rsquo;s bond. He is as
square a man as ever stood in leather. If he wanted to
borrow half my fortune till to-morrow, with no better
security than his word alone, he could have it, and I
should sleep soundly to-night, knowing that he had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surprise me, Nick. I should not have formed
that opinion of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am but incidentally setting you right as to the
man,&rdquo; added Nick. &ldquo;He is not a ruffian, nor is he a
rascal, save in one way. He is well educated, a student
of the sciences, and an admirer of the fine arts. His
bachelor quarters are filled with superb treasures and
paintings well worth seeing, a veritable art gallery in fact.
I know that he gives most liberally to charity, moreover,
and I am informed that no man was ever enticed into or
intentionally cheated in his gaming-place, which is open
only to the very wealthy and most exclusive of our men
about town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, if he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s enough for Flood, my dear Gilsey. If your
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
man Kendall has been one of his patrons, I shall know it
before midnight. At nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning I
will meet you here, or communicate with you by telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I shall then have located Kendall? Most decidedly
I do, Gilsey. Trust me to be discreet, however,
and to have your wishes well in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks, Nick. I knew you would help me
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, old friend,&rdquo; said Nick, as they shook hands.
&ldquo;Let the case rest until morning. The few hours will
make no great difference one way or the other. Be here
at nine to-morrow morning, and you shall know the&mdash;well,
let&rsquo;s hope it will be, not the worst, but the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen to that!&rdquo; said Gilsey fervently.</p>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock when Nick Carter left the Trust
Company building and emerged into Forty-second Street.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the case did not appeal very
strongly to the famous detective. His regard for Gilsey,
much more than any feeling of interest in the affair, had
led Nick to undertake the task imposed.</p>
<p>As to the case itself, it then presented no unusual nor
especially interesting features. If Kendall had been
gambling, as Nick was then inclined to suspect, it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
very possible that he was an embezzler, and had already
fled from the country. Yet Nick decided that he would
be governed by Gilsey&rsquo;s wishes until the following morning.</p>
<p>Contrary to his anticipations, however, despite that
Nick Carter was quick to see all the possibilities of a case,
that into which he had now entered was destined to prove
one of the most curious and absorbing, as well as most
intensely exciting, that he had ever known.</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s first move for locating Kendall that afternoon
was characteristic of him. He turned to none of the
avenues of information to which the ordinary detective
usually turns. Instead, he hastened to the Grand Central
Station and boarded the first train for Fordham,
his destination being the rectory occupied by the learned
divine, Doctor Leonard Royal. Nick reasoned that if
Harry Royal had visited Boston with Kendall, and Dora
Royal was in love with him, either the clergyman or his
daughter could give him the information he desired.</p>
<p>As he approached the rectory, however, Nick met with
a startling surprise. It was a fine old place, somewhat
isolated, and was surrounded with no end of great shade
trees, clusters of shrubbery, and high hedges. The dwelling
itself, occupying the middle of the large estate, was
a commodious wooden house, with deep verandas and
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
innumerable gables, and with a huge glass conservatory
on the south side.</p>
<p>Peering through the high hedge adjoining the side
street as he approached, Nick halted, with a muttered
exclamation of surprise. Two men, one of them the
elderly rector, were just entering the outer door of the
conservatory.</p>
<p>The rector&rsquo;s companion was none other than&mdash;Moses
Flood, the gamester!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He here!&rdquo; murmured Nick. &ldquo;What the dickens does
this signify? He is the last man I would expect to see
visiting this clergyman. If Gilsey&rsquo;s brother banker was
right, there may be much more in this case than I anticipated.
The way looks easy, and I guess I&rsquo;d better learn
what brings Moses Flood out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having worked his way through the hedge, Nick
crossed the grounds, carefully avoiding observation from
the house, and presently darted under a cluster of lilacs
close to the side wall of the great glass conservatory.</p>
<p>There he could plainly view the scene within, and he
presently found a break in one of the glass panes which
enabled him to overhear all that was said&mdash;an interview
that caused him to open his eyes still a little wider.</p>
<p>The elderly rector was seated in a rustic chair, and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
benignant countenance evinced considerable perturbation
and distress.</p>
<p>Moses Flood, however, was standing beside a small
wooden table near-by, and as the story progresses he is to
figure so strongly and strangely that he deserves a careful
description.</p>
<p>He was about forty-five, tall and well built, inclining
somewhat to stoutness. His wavy hair was tinged with
gray, his head finely poised, and his smoothly shaven
face strikingly strong and attractive. His features were
clean cut and pale, his brow broad, his nose straight, and
his lips noticeably thin and firm. His eyes were gray,
as sharp and cold as steel, yet capable of remarkable
expression. Obviously, it was the face of a man of
superhuman will, and one rather inclined to quiet reserve
and studious habits.</p>
<p>He was scrupulously dressed. His black Prince Albert
fitted like a glove and came nearly to the knees of his
pearl-gray trousers. His shoes were small and carefully
polished, and his silk hat, on the table beside him,
was of the latest style. His only jewelry was a small,
piercingly brilliant solitaire in his black satin tie. From
head to foot he was without a sign of dust or blemish.</p>
<p>This was the man whom Nick Carter had declared to
be a rascal in only one way, and Nick fully appreciated
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
that gaming was not confined to cards alone, and for
many of his estimable qualities Nick rather admired
Moses Flood.</p>
<p>The drift of the interview between the two men almost
immediately gave Nick Carter his cue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must hear me patiently,&rdquo; Doctor Royal was tremulously
saying. &ldquo;I do not forget the past few months,
Mr. Flood. I recall with profound feeling your many
personal attentions to me, your liberality for charity, your
almost princely generosity for the poor of my parish, and
it is painful to me beyond expression when I realize how
terribly I have been deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood stood as motionless as a man of marble, and
nearly as pale; yet his grave, strong face never once
changed in a way to betray his secret feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel, then, that you have been deceived?&rdquo; said he
inquiringly, with a peculiarly deep yet penetrating voice,
then imbued with kindliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadfully deceived,&rdquo; replied the rector sadly. &ldquo;Of
my daughter, and the love for her you have just expressed,
I cannot now speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; muttered Nick, under his breath. &ldquo;Flood
is in love with the girl here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my son Harry,&rdquo; continued the rector, &ldquo;who of late
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
has been much absent from me while in college&mdash;ah, it
breaks my heart, as it would that of his loving sister, to
know that he places among his friends a man of your
calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the deception to which you refer, Doctor
Royal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what else, sir? I cannot forget that it was my
dear boy who brought you here, and only to-day, when I
had begun to regard you with almost brotherly affection,
have you voluntarily told me the truth. You were represented
to me to be in the ivory business. Alas! I now
can see the significance of that. But I had all faith in my
son, and looked for no such duplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally not,&rdquo; said Flood simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been a frequent visitor here, and have won
the esteem of all my house, and God only knows how
pained I am to learn the truth that must forever sever
our friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears in the rector&rsquo;s aged eyes, but Flood
never moved nor changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May not a gamester be a true friend?&rdquo; he asked
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a worthy one&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you consider me a knave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your vocation brands you as one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not undertake, Doctor Royal, to defend my vocation,&rdquo;
said Flood, with indescribable gentleness. &ldquo;It
would be vain for me to try to show one of your cloth
that but very little moral difference exists between my
methods and those of numberless institutions countenanced
complacently both by law and society&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no extenuation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, please! I came here at your son&rsquo;s solicitation,
rather against my own will, and I believed my first
visit would be my last. Fate decided otherwise. I met
your only daughter&mdash;&mdash; Nay, sir, do not shudder! I
have never yet spoken to her one word of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If her love were to have been given to me, it was my
plan to relinquish my present business and turn to one
honorable in the eyes of all. I first came to you, Doctor
Royal, and told the whole truth. Believe me, despite
your censure, even a gamester may love nobly. But no
more need be said. I shall respect and be governed by a
father&rsquo;s will and wishes. Your manner and words show
me that under no consideration can you deem me
worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;No longer worthy of my roof&mdash;much less my daughter!&rdquo;
answered the rector, trembling, and in tears.</p>
<p>Despite that Flood&rsquo;s pale face remained as calm as
stone, Nick, with his keen discernment, saw that the man
was suffering beyond description, and, in a way, the
kind-hearted detective pitied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of your roof? Ah, well, let it be so,&rdquo; replied
Flood, taking his hat from the table.</p>
<p>Doctor Royal rose, trembling, to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances I cannot permit you to come
here again,&rdquo; said he brokenly. &ldquo;I shall send for my son,
and I hope soon to know the whole truth. God help
me, sir, my two children are all I have in this life; and
my daughter&mdash;I do not speak in judgment&mdash;a man like
you can have no place in her pure, young heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood bowed with indescribable composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet a man like me, Doctor Royal, may be capable of a
great love, and possibly capable of great self-sacrifice.
No more, sir. I bid you good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; pleaded the rector, deeply agitated. &ldquo;There
is still another reason why my daughter could not consider
any proposal from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is already engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged!&rdquo; Flood echoed, starting slightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not yet announced,&rdquo; faltered the clergyman.
&ldquo;Had I known the nature and depth of your feelings,
however, I would have told you earlier. But Mr. Kendall
desired it kept quiet for a time, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kendall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cecil Kendall&mdash;you have met him here once, I believe.
He is an exemplary young man. In all ways worthy of
my Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time the features of Moses Flood appeared
to get the better of his iron will. His hand stole
over his heart, his lips contracted and twitched convulsively
for a moment, and his voice choked in his
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she, your daughter, love Cecil Kendall?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devotedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively, sir. It would break Medora&rsquo;s heart if any
ill befell Mr. Kendall, or if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; interposed Flood, with cheeks utterly
void of color. &ldquo;You mean well, sir, and have not spoken
unkindly. I shall not forget it, nor that you are the
father of one more dear to me than life. I bid you
adieu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed, put on his hat, then passed out of the conservatory
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
by the door they had entered, and strode across
the broad grounds and into the quiet and secluded street.</p>
<p>The rector tottered toward a door leading into the side
of the house.</p>
<p>He had barely reached it when, from behind a mass of
shrubbery near-by, Nick Carter heard a mingled moan
and sob that caused his heart to swell with sudden
apprehension. He darted to the spot, and beheld a girl
reeling, half fainting, with her face buried in her hands,
and her pretty figure shaken through and through with
welling sobs.</p>
<p>One glance told Nick it was the rector&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>With a bound he reached her side, taking her by the
arm, while his own kindly face revealed a mingled
solicitude and apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, my dear girl!&rdquo; he cried softly. &ldquo;You,
too, have overheard, and you have met with a grievous
trouble. Turn to me in this hour, and&mdash;hush! don&rsquo;t let
your father hear you. There may be a silver lining to
the blackest cloud, my child. Let me be your friend in
this hour of your grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The startled girl stared at him through her flooded
eyes, and by the dropping of her hands revealed a face as
sweet and innocent as that of an angel.</p>
<p>Meantime, Moses Flood was hastening to the city,
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
where, later in the day, as he was approaching his famous
gambling resort, he encountered on the street a woman
who unceremoniously accosted him.</p>
<p>The woman was Belle Braddon, arrayed in elaborate
street attire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mose!&rdquo; she exclaimed familiarly, with an arch
glance and smile.</p>
<p>Flood was not in a mood to be pleased with her
familiarity, nor even to resent it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Belle,&rdquo; he replied, bowing gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; she quickly added, drawing nearer, with
voice lowered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best look out for a bolt from the
blue. One of your players is in hot water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s cold, steel-gray eyes took on a look of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What player, Belle?&rdquo; he slowly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confidentially, mind you, dear fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to Cecil Kendall,&rdquo; whispered the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone lame. Short in his accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s teeth had met with a snap, and his eyes were
beginning to blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what I&rsquo;m saying,&rdquo; Belle Braddon pointedly
continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the same office with him, you
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
know. When it&rsquo;s up to me to get wise to all that&rsquo;s going
on, I come mighty near doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses Flood was calm again&mdash;strangely, preternaturally
calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how much he is short?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only ninety thousand dollars!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl,
with a leer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is being done about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much as yet, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gilsey wants to locate Kendall as quickly as possible,
and has called in Nick Carter to do it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens! Nick Carter, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilsey evidently thinks that Kendall believes he has
left his tracks covered during his absence, and means to
try to carry the deficit a while longer undetected. Gilsey
is wise to it, though, but I reckon nothing will be done for
a day or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all now, Mose,&rdquo; laughed the girl, with a wink.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite enough,&rdquo; said he oddly. &ldquo;Belle, dear, keep this
to yourself till I give you permission to open your lips
about it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The girl colored deeply when thus addressed, and
slipped her hand into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; she answered fondly. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;d do
anything for you, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do this, then, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one word about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as dumb as an oyster&mdash;for your sake, mind you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget that part of it, Belle,&rdquo; said Flood
pointedly.</p>
<p>Then he turned and moved on&mdash;and his face was a
study for an artist.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE TIGER&rsquo;S CLAWS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Last turn! Four for one if you call it right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monotonous voice of the cuekeeper, announcing
with hackneyed phrase the alluring possibility, broke the
strained silence of an elaborately furnished room.</p>
<p>It was a room on the second floor of the famous
gambling resort owned and conducted by Moses Flood.
It was that particular room in the house in which King
Faro held sole sway.</p>
<p>The house was in a fashionable street, and had an
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
attractive exterior. No layman would have dreamed that
it masked a lair of vice. It was a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
<p>It was one of a superb block of brown sandstone residences
within a stone&rsquo;s throw of Fifth Avenue, with a
broad flight of carved steps leading to the front door.
The elegant stained windows of this front door, as well
as those of the lower rooms, were protected with strong,
iron gratings, that thieves might not break through and
steal.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the police also were thus excluded&mdash;unless
they came with a warrant. In that case, even, which a
wardman was liberally paid to prevent, they would have
&ldquo;found nothing.&rdquo; It takes time to read a search-warrant&mdash;all
the time that would be required to effect a transformation
scene within. Such are the precautions taken
by vice.</p>
<p>Entrance could be had only with the sanction of a burly
attendant constantly at the front door, and by means of
the magic talisman of previous acquaintance, or the
voucher of a known and reliable friend. One entering
from the street would have seen only a superbly furnished
hall, with sumptuous parlors adjoining, and a
library and smoking-room beyond.</p>
<p>To see more, one must go higher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The tiger lurks on the floors above.</p>
<p>To one only of the upper rooms is attention here invited&mdash;the
room already mentioned.</p>
<p>It was large and richly furnished. A heavy Wilton
carpet covered the floor. Massive walnut chairs stood a
little away from the beautifully frescoed walls, and the
ceiling, done in exquisite colors, and so as to produce the
effect of height, revealed a lavish expenditure of money.
It might have been a room in a king&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>Rare paintings adorned the walls. A large sideboard,
rich with silver and cut glass, stood at the back of the
room. Costly ornaments occupied shelves and niches
here and there.</p>
<p>The door leading to the main hall of the house was
closed and heavily barred. It had in one panel a &ldquo;peek,&rdquo;
so called, with a moving slide, through which an attendant
could look into the hall. This was another precaution
taken by vice.</p>
<p>At the front of the room was a long, baize-covered
table, on which was a faro layout, the various suits
painted in natural colors on enameled cloth. It was the
tiger, courted while feared. It should have been called
the snake, for it fascinated before it killed, rendering
powerless the victims it lured to destruction.</p>
<p>Back of the table sat the dealer, who played his luck
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
against all opponents. His duties were arduous. He sold
the stacks of ivory chips, handled all the money, shuffled
and dealt the cards from the silver deal box before him,
and took or paid all bets. He seldom spoke unless
addressed. His brain was active, his eyes alert, his
hands busy; but his face, whether he won or lost, evinced
no emotion.</p>
<p>In a chair to his right, and somewhat above the table,
sat the lookout. His duty was to see that the dealer
made no mistakes. The lookout thus protects the house.
The players have no protection. They who &ldquo;buck the
tiger&rdquo; must look out for themselves.</p>
<p>At one end of the table sat the cuekeeper. In front
of him on the table lay the cue-rack, a small wooden
frame, pierced with wires, on which movable buttons
indicate the cards already dealt and those still remaining
in the deal box.</p>
<p>The cuekeeper in a faro-bank is every man&rsquo;s menial.
The losers curse him; the winners sometimes tip him.
The cuekeeper in this place was a humpback, named John
Green. He more frequently was called Humpty. All
cuekeepers are malformations; the longer they live, the
worse they become.</p>
<p>On a couch at one side of the room a young man lay
sleeping. It was the deep, dead sleep of intoxication.
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
Yet he was well clad, and his boyish features indicated
culture and refinement. His name was&mdash;Harry Royal.</p>
<p>The companion with whom he had entered this place
some hours earlier was seated at the gaming-table, in a
chair directly opposite the dealer and amid several other
players. He was a tall, fair man, and his knit brows, his
pressed lips, his glowing eyes, and tremulous hands, indicated
his intense interest in the game then in progress.</p>
<p>He appeared quite collected, however, and placed his
bets promptly, like one playing a system. He was setting
a rapid pace, too, if one might judge from the stacks of
chips in front of him. Yet he plainly was not a winner.
The ugly light in his frowning eyes was convincing evidence
of that.</p>
<p>Such was the place, and the employment of its several
occupants, which Moses Flood was at that hour approaching.</p>
<p>The May day was drawing to a close, and the dusk of
early evening had begun to fall.</p>
<p>The cuekeeper repeated his announcement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last turn! Four for one if you call it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man last described glanced at the cuekeeper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in, Humpty?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cat-hop, Mr. Kendall&mdash;two kings and a seven.
He&rsquo;s got to show a king first, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; replied the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
humpback, with a weird smile stealing over his broad,
unpleasant-looking face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two to one he does,&rdquo; growled Kendall, as the
dealer briefly paused before making the turn.</p>
<p>Kendall placed a hundred to win on the seven, coppered
the king for a like amount, and called the turn for
fifty.</p>
<p>Several other players, most of whom were wealthy
bloods about town, men who would have given thousands
rather than have been caught in Flood&rsquo;s gaming-house&mdash;these
men also had placed their bets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; queried the dealer indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her come, Mr. Bruce,&rdquo; said one impatiently.</p>
<p>Tom Bruce, a dealer who had been in Flood&rsquo;s employ
for several years, deftly pushed the cards from the box.</p>
<p>He showed a seven, and then two kings.</p>
<p>Cecil Kendall had lost two hundred and fifty dollars on
the turn.</p>
<p>For the bare fraction of a second he shrank, shuddered
visibly, and his drawn features took on a deathly pallor
and the haggard look of secret despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse the infernal luck!&rdquo; he growled audibly. &ldquo;Will
it never change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lookout, a man named Nathan Godard, also in
Flood&rsquo;s employ, smiled faintly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Kendall?&rdquo; he asked, in bantering
fashion. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get &rsquo;em down right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get those bets down right, that&rsquo;s evident,&rdquo;
snarled Kendall bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t see, Godard, isn&rsquo;t worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so? You must be a loser, Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About eighteen hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, don&rsquo;t let it bother you,&rdquo; laughed Godard, a
bit maliciously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not playing for your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall evidently did not like the interference, nor the
tone in which the last remarks were made. He glanced
sharply up at the rather unprepossessing face of the
speaker, and retorted curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not for my life, Nate Godard! But I&rsquo;m playing
for something as dear to me as life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fortune, eh?&rdquo; grinned Godard, not in the least disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a fortune,&rdquo; snapped Kendall.</p>
<p>The dealer glanced across the table at him, still shuffling
the cards for the next deal, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>Godard, however, could not resist voicing the thought
that arose in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re playing for something more dear than
either life or fortune, Kendall, you&rsquo;re taking infernally
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
long chances,&rdquo; said he pointedly. &ldquo;Honor is something
not wisely staked upon a faro layout, and if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant Kendall was upon his feet, ghastly with
passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who spoke of honor?&rdquo; he cried furiously. &ldquo;Do you
dare imply that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>The bell on the hall door had rung sharply.</p>
<p>It rang an immediate knell to the brief disturbance.</p>
<p>It brought a moment of absolute silence, in which every
eye was turned swiftly toward the door.</p>
<p>Humpty Green, the malformation, leaped up from his
chair and ran to the peek. One glance was sufficient. He
closed the slide, then threw both hands above his head
with a grotesque gesture of warning.</p>
<p>The eyes of all were upon him. His lips moved, but
his voice, was silent, yet all received the mute message
he conveyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! It&rsquo;s the boss! It&rsquo;s Moses Flood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he removed the heavy bar and opened the door.</p>
<p>Moses Flood, with face as calm as a sea of ice, gravely
entered the room.</p>
<p>He was followed closely by two men, both of whom
were in disguise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>One was the famous New York detective&rsquo;s chief assistant,
Chick Carter.</p>
<p>The other was Nick Carter, the great detective himself.</p>
<p>The humpback closed the heavy door and replaced the
bar.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />A FRIEND IN NEED.</h2>
<p>Before depicting the thrilling episodes that followed the
entrance of Nick Carter and Chick into Moses Flood&rsquo;s
gambling-house, it is necessary, in order that Nick&rsquo;s
conduct may be better appreciated, to revert to his meeting
with Dora Royal near the rectory conservatory, and
present the remainder of the interview.</p>
<p>That the girl had overheard all that had passed between
Flood and her father, and that her discovery of the gamester&rsquo;s
vocation came upon her with a shock that overwhelmed
and crushed her, were at once painfully apparent
to Nick, who quickly interpreted the true significance
of her touching grief.</p>
<p>It awakened a feeling of sympathy in the kind-hearted
detective, moreover, together with a desire to befriend
the girl, if possible, with which aim in view he gently
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
drew her back of the conservatory and out of sight from
the windows of the house.</p>
<p>Having made sure that they were safe from the eyes
and ears of others, Nick brought all his kind influence to
bear, and soon succeeded in getting Miss Royal into a
more composed state.</p>
<p>She was barely twenty, an innocent and artless girl,
obviously unused to the ways of the world, and that her
secret heart had been won by the strong and magnetic
nature of Moses Flood, while she was entirely ignorant
of his vocation, did not in the least surprise the detective.
How he could now serve her best, however, was Nick&rsquo;s
immediate and chief consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come, Miss Royal, I want you to confide in me,&rdquo;
said he, in a kindly and impressive way. &ldquo;You are in
trouble, and need a good friend, one who knows all the
ways of the world, and just what is of true value in it.
I shall have only your happiness and welfare at heart, I
assure you, and very possibly I can do more for you than
you imagine. Come, now, and confide in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl heard him like one in a dream at first, but
Nick had an influence at such times that was quite
irresistible, and Dora Royal soon began drying her
pretty eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you are a stranger to me, sir,&rdquo; she protested, in
charming uncertainty. &ldquo;I never saw you before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, so I am, and I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rdquo;
laughed Nick, in a way to further reassure her. &ldquo;I felt
so moved by your grief that I really forgot to be conventional.
Here is my card, Miss Royal. Perhaps you
know me by name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you the famous detective?&rdquo; faltered Dora,
with glistening eyes, raised from the card to seek his.</p>
<p>Nick laughed again, and his smile proved to be contagious
this time, for the drawn lips of the girl began to
relax a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Nick Carter, the detective,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;How
great I am I leave others to say. I certainly should feel
that I had done something worthy, Miss Royal, were I to
succeed in restoring all you now feel to be lost to you.
Who knows but I may, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Detective Carter, do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how? If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, let&rsquo;s get at this in proper order, that there may
be no misunderstanding,&rdquo; interposed Nick, smiling.
&ldquo;First, let me know that you desire me for a friend, and
that you feel you can trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, sir. Your name alone is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you rely blindly upon my judgment, and consent
to follow my advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, sir,&rdquo; bowed Dora. &ldquo;I am sure it will be
good advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never anything else,&rdquo; declared Nick heartily. &ldquo;Will
you also confide in me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, sir, if you require it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall not ask you to tell me very much that I
do not already know,&rdquo; said Nick, with a sort of paternal
fondness. &ldquo;How did you happen to overhear the interview
yonder? I&rsquo;m sure you did not deliberately play the
eavesdropper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no; I would not have done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was reading in the shade of the shrubbery near-by,
and when they began speaking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You literally could not move, eh?&rdquo; Nick again interposed.
&ldquo;Ah, well, I saw that the disclosure quite overwhelmed
you, and perhaps it was all for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best, sir? Oh, how can that be? If Mr. Flood is as
bad as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As your worthy father really implied, he would be a
very bad man, indeed,&rdquo; laughed Nick quietly. &ldquo;But
your good father is both right and wrong, Miss Royal.
There are far worse men than Moses Flood, my dear
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
girl; and if he were to throw up his miserable vocation,
which he intimated he intended doing for your sake, he
would be a man whose hand I would grasp as a friend
and brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Detective Carter, do you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who knows, Miss Royal, but that we yet may lead
him to do so, and your father into regarding the matter
in a rather different light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we only could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do not enthuse too quickly, my dear,&rdquo; laughed
Nick. &ldquo;The job is yet to be done, as we detectives say,
and the task must be yours and mine alone. No third
party must be admitted to our secret, mind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, I will do whatever you advise,&rdquo; declared
Dora, now quite aglow with reawakened hopes. &ldquo;I am
sure you mean to be my friend, Detective Carter, and I
will trust you blindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will never regret it,&rdquo; bowed Nick, gently
pressing the hand she impulsively had given him. &ldquo;You
need not tell me that you love Mr. Flood, for I already
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, he has been so kind and generous; so attentive
to us all, and so gentle and dignified&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, never mind that,&rdquo; smiled Nick. &ldquo;All that
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
is like Mr. Flood. Tell me, however, if any one else suspects
your affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir. Indeed, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I inferred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have kept it all to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of Mr. Kendall? I think your father told
Flood you were engaged to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora blushed a little, and appeared confused for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, sir. I have no deeper feeling than that of
esteem for Mr. Kendall,&rdquo; she presently replied. &ldquo;I
greatly fear that my father drew upon his imagination
somewhat, and merely aimed to insure the end of Mr.
Flood&rsquo;s visits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very likely,&rdquo; nodded Nick. &ldquo;Yet you would have
let Flood go without disabusing him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned and pointed toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is an aged man, sir, and I have been taught
to be dutiful and obedient,&rdquo; said she, with charming
simplicity. &ldquo;I saw him in tears when he dismissed the
man, who, without knowing it, has won my love. I could
do no less than remain silent, sir, and abide my own
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good girl,&rdquo; said Nick gravely. &ldquo;I shall do
all I can, Miss Royal, to turn matters in your favor.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Meantime, however, should anything happen and you
need advice, I want you to come to me, or send for me,
and I will come to you. It may be greatly to your
advantage to do so, rather than to go to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, I surely will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without fail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without fail, Detective Carter. I will appeal to you
only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; bowed Nick. &ldquo;Now, one thing more,
and I then must leave you for the present. When was
Mr. Kendall last here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a week ago, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in Boston, sir; and my brother is with him,&rdquo;
said Dora. &ldquo;But we expected Harry to return this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly he has been unavoidably delayed,&rdquo; said Nick,
now convinced that none at the rectory could give him
the information he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine that is so, Mr. Carter,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>Nick deferred his departure only to add a few words
of advice and instruction, then made his way out of the
grounds and returned to the city. He left Dora Royal,
if not the happier because of his visit, at least encouraged
by his kindly assurances. There was nothing new or
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
strange in this interest thus exhibited by Nick. It was
second nature to him to try to serve those he found in
distress, particularly in such a case as this.</p>
<p>On arriving in town Nick hastened to his residence
and there had a talk with Chick, his chief assistant, to
whom he imparted the whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to locate Kendall this evening, if possible,&rdquo; said
he, in conclusion. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bare chance that we may
find him at Flood&rsquo;s gambling-house, or there get a line
on his whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as likely as not,&rdquo; nodded Chick, in genial assent.
&ldquo;Why not go up there, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well come along. There may be something
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough! What disguise, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The usual one, Chick, and I&rsquo;ll slip into my make-up as
Joe Badger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready as soon as you are, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their pursuit of criminals it frequently became
necessary for the Carters to visit the gambling-houses
about town, both high and low. The presence of a detective,
however, if known as such, is always objectionable
to the proprietors of these places. For which reason
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
both Nick and Chick had each a disguise in which, at
such places, they were supposed to be men addicted to
gaming, and were freely given admission. With the
opening of any new house of this character, both at once
cultivated the acquaintance of the managers, and thereafter
visited the place only often enough to keep up
appearances, or when in search of some crook.</p>
<p>Nick frequently had been in Flood&rsquo;s sumptuously furnished
house, where he was known as Badger, and none
dreamed of his being a detective, not even Flood himself.</p>
<p>It was about seven o&rsquo;clock that evening when Nick
and Chick approached the gambling-house, and as luck
would have it, they encountered Flood just as he was
entering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Badger,&rdquo; the gamester said politely,
as the three men mounted the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Flood?&rdquo; rejoined Nick. &ldquo;You remember
my friend here, Tom Cory? He was here with me
about a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not recall his face,&rdquo; smiled Flood gravely. &ldquo;Possibly
I was absent at the time. Glad to meet you, Mr.
Cory. Any gentleman recommended by Mr. Badger is
always welcome here. Come in, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Flood shook Nick by the hand, while the attendant
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
at the street door closed the heavy portal behind
them.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later the clang of the bell silenced the
disturbance at the faro table, as previously described,
and the three men entered the tiger&rsquo;s lair.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />A TURN OF LUCK.</h2>
<p>The effect of Moses Flood&rsquo;s entrance into his gambling
place was magical. It was as if a king had come into
the presence of half-a-dozen squabbling courtiers.</p>
<p>Godard shrank back in his lookout chair and relapsed
into silence. The several players who had risen in the
brief excitement resumed their seats with an air of unconcern,
and the dealer continued his shuffling of the
cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; Flood quietly demanded.</p>
<p>He halted for a moment, erect and motionless, with
his piercing eyes bent darkly on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the humpback, as he
dropped the bar across the closed door. &ldquo;A bit of
backcap, that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had better be,&rdquo; was the significant response.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s keen eyes had taken in the situation, yet his
coldly dispassionate countenance masked his feelings as
with a veil of ice. He passed back of the table, gravely
greeting the several players, then paused to gaze down
at the sleeping youth on the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come in with you?&rdquo; he asked, turning soberly
to Cecil Kendall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the latter, with a faint smile crossing
his pale face. &ldquo;We have been over to Boston. Only
returned this noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been drinking heavily, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wayward fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to dissuade him,&rdquo; muttered Kendall. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in
no shape to go home, so we dropped in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s face was clouded with a censorious frown as
he turned away to place his hat on a rack near-by.</p>
<p>Godard had made no further remarks, but sat staring
oddly at Kendall, who now appeared to ignore him.</p>
<p>The humpback had resumed his position at the end of
the table, with his legs curled under him in his chair,
with his ungainly head drawn down between his
shoulders, and his attention directed upon the movements
of the dealer, who had thrust the cards into the
box and was about to start a new deal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Just then, however, Moses Flood approached him from
behind and detained him with a significant touch on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>Bruce did not commence to deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are they coming, Kendall?&rdquo; Flood quietly asked,
with a glance at the former&rsquo;s chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocky,&rdquo; said Kendall, with a sickly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Win these, Mose, and you have my pile. I shall be
down and out, in more senses than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood knew too well what he meant, yet his countenance
did not change by so much as a shadow. He addressed
the dealer, saying gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get your supper, Tom, and I will deal while
you are out,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I shall wish to be away for an
hour or two after you return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Godard, may rearrange that sideboard, if you
will. It looks as if it had been struck by lightning. The
cues can declare it if I overpay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much danger of that, Mr. Flood,&rdquo; smiled Godard,
as the two men at once complied.</p>
<p>Flood made no reply. He wheeled the lookout&rsquo;s chair
a little to one side, as if it was in his way. In fact, however,
he wanted no one in it during the next half-hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Then he took the dealer&rsquo;s seat at the table, that which
Tom Bruce had vacated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may draw the curtains back of me, John, and
close the window. I feel a draft,&rdquo; said he, addressing
the cuekeeper.</p>
<p>He never called him by his nickname. In his sight the
deformed man&rsquo;s affliction was great enough as it was.
This showed of what the nature of Moses Flood was
capable.</p>
<p>He had removed his coat and opened his vest. He was
rather slow in his movements, and not without an object.
He had been on fire within. He now was cooling down.
He was setting his nerves to the extraordinary task he
saw before him.</p>
<p>As the humpback left the window, Flood turned as if
to see that it was closed. For the moment his face was
averted from the several players. Only Humpty Green
could see it, and he caught from Flood&rsquo;s eyes a flash that
thrilled him through and through. It was a magnetic
telegram, an unuttered command. It was understood,
and the cuekeeper was startled; but even the cuekeeper
in a faro-bank commands his emotions. Without a
change of countenance he resumed his seat.</p>
<p>Meantime, Nick Carter and Chick had sauntered over
to the sideboard, then dropped into two chairs near the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
wall, where they sat, quietly talking and pretending to
be sizing up the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your man, all right,&rdquo; murmured Chick, when
Kendall&rsquo;s name was mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Nick. &ldquo;That is about what I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to arrest him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at present. I&rsquo;m not sure that he is guilty of
embezzlement, and Gilsey wished to give him till to-morrow
to report at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep an eye on him, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; muttered Nick. &ldquo;By Jove! there&rsquo;s something
out of the ordinary going to come off here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Flood&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s as colorless as marble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;tis, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something in the wind. He has got rid of
his dealer and sent his lookout from the chair. By all
that&rsquo;s good and great, Chick, I believe he&rsquo;s up to some
extraordinary move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wait to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of this was overheard by others, and the two
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
detectives gave no sign of observing anything unusual.
It took Nick&rsquo;s keen eyes and broad experience, moreover,
to detect in Moses Flood the slightest indication of what
he had in mind.</p>
<p>Flood had reverted to the table, and the light again
fell full on his face. It was pale, yet composed; stern,
yet not evil; expressive, yet changeless.</p>
<p>He was thinking of the girl to whose hand he had
aspired, of the rector whose censorious words still were
ringing in his ears; and he was thinking, too, of the
wretched man seated opposite, a man who had fallen
lower and sinned deeper than he had ever done.</p>
<p>He was about to do what only one man in millions
would have done. He believed what the rector had told
him, that Dora Royal loved this man, who, were his sin
to be brought home to him, would become a criminal at
law and an outcast of society.</p>
<p>For the sake of the girl, and to preserve her happiness,
Moses Flood, looking for no return, not so much even as
a smile of gratitude, was about to secretly sacrifice a
goodly part of his fortune upon the altar of his own hopeless
affection.</p>
<p>He had spoken the truth, this man, when he said, &ldquo;Even
a gamester may love nobly, and be capable of great self-sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Yet his face was a mask, hiding the emotions within.</p>
<p>One man only among all his observers could read it
aright&mdash;Nick Carter.</p>
<p>Flood laid aside the deal box lately used, and took
another from a lower drawer of the table, of which he
alone had the key.</p>
<p>The box appeared to be precisely like the other&mdash;but
it was not. With slight manipulation, the dealer could
lower an invisible plate within, thus widening the slot
through which the cards were dealt, allowing the passage
of two cards instead of one. The mechanism could not be
discovered, except with close examination, and even then
a novice would not detect it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the other box?&rdquo; demanded
a player, at once betraying a gambler&rsquo;s suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I know of,&rdquo; said Flood coldly. &ldquo;Why
do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for no reason. I wondered why you shifted,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wanted to,&rdquo; said Flood. &ldquo;I prefer to work
with my own tools. Are you suspicious? If so, you are
not invited to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my word is of weight with you, however, you may
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
be sure that a false card was never dealt in this place, to
my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he spoke the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game is strong enough without it,&rdquo; smiled Kendall,
over whom, as over all, Moses Flood seemed to
exercise a strangely magnetic influence.</p>
<p>The latter made no reply, but took from the same
drawer a deck of cards bound with a rubber, which he
deliberately removed and threw to the floor. They were
well seasoned, and of a rare and expensive quality, and
unique design. They were of the kind known as &ldquo;crazy
backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter recognized them the moment his gaze
lighted on them. He leaned nearer to Chick and whispered
quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to suspect what&rsquo;s coming off here, Chick.
That&rsquo;s a brace box, for a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens! Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, indeed. And that deck of cards he has just
brought up, Chick, is a deck of strippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are strippers, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cards used for dealing one kind of a brace game,&rdquo;
whispered Nick. &ldquo;They are cut just the least bit wider
at one end than the other. The narrow ends of the
cards forming the middle of the layout are turned one
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
way in shuffling, and those comprising the ends of the
layout are turned the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple as two and two,&rdquo; replied Nick softly. &ldquo;After
shuffling the deck, the dealer takes the wide end of the
cards between his thumbs and middle fingers, and with
a movement so rapid as to defy detection, he strips them
apart. Then he holds in one hand the cards corresponding
to the ends of the layout, and in the other those comprising
the middle. After putting them together, and
placing them in the box, he knows almost to a certainty
which cards are to win and which to lose throughout the
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil you say!&rdquo; muttered Chick. &ldquo;Then there
must, indeed, be something coming off here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, a word concerning the brace game Nick had
partly described. Suppose that a player bets heavily
upon an end card of the layout to win.</p>
<p>The dealer sees that the bet is placed correctly, and for
him to win the amount wagered it is necessary for him to
reverse the combination of the cards. What does he do?
He presses down on the secret plate in the box, and in
making the turn, instead of dealing two cards, a winner
and a loser, he deals three, and so adroitly that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
deception is not observed. This reverses the combination,
and the player referred to must lose. It is called
&ldquo;taking a card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is necessary, also, that the cues should show
correctly at the end of the deal. The cuekeeper watches
the dealer attentively. The latter, after taking a card,
signs by prearranged signals to the former, who raps
once with a chip against the side of the cue-rack, which
signifies that the card taken is recorded, and at the end of
the deal the cues are right.</p>
<p>Sometimes the cards are marked also, that the dealer
may know each turn before making it. This is called
&ldquo;dealing at sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is all this that has been described? It is one way
by which men thrust their hands into their brother&rsquo;s
pocket and rob him. It is more ignoble than stopping one
in the darkness, and commanding him, at the point of a
weapon, &ldquo;Stand and deliver!&rdquo; It is one of the methods
by which is dealt the perfidious &ldquo;brace faro!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the box and such the cards which Moses
Flood had placed on the table before him.</p>
<p>The goggle eyes of Humpty Green began to open
wider, his ungainly face to grow pale and grave. He
had never known of such in the place, but the master
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
had commanded and the menial would obey. He drew
his chair closer to the table.</p>
<p>Amid that momentous silence which invariably marks
the opening of a new deal, Moses Flood, his pale features
fixed like marble, his eyes steadfastly intense, his white
hands nerved to their performance, began to shuffle the
cards. His movements were rapid and graceful. In the
flash of an eye he had stripped the deck asunder, cut it,
and placed it in the box. A six showed at the top; the
ends of the layout were winners, the middle losers.</p>
<p>Flood sat back in his chair and waited the placing of
bets. With an experienced eye he sized Kendall&rsquo;s remaining
chips; there were about six hundred dollars&rsquo;
worth. The other players were wagering small amounts,
and he gave them no attention. His mind was upon the
man directly opposite.</p>
<p>Kendall&rsquo;s hand trembled when it placed his first bet.
He went on to the six to lose. He believed that he alone
of all the world knew his dire need of winning.</p>
<p>This bet was wrongly placed, and Flood knew it, yet
made a turn. There was no decision, but a king had
showed winner, and Kendall coppered the next. In
a spirit of antagonism he was bucking the cards.</p>
<p>Moses Flood leaned forward and glanced down upon
the box. He could see the edges of the three top cards.
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
They were marked by small, red dots, invisible to the
players. Suddenly he made the turn. It was done like
a flash. His forefinger touched for an instant the left
lower corner of the box, and the silence was broken by
the quick, responsive rap of the cuekeeper. He had
taken a five. The cue was marked up, and the combination
was reversed.</p>
<p>Cecil Kendall had won his first bet&mdash;and the face of
the humpback was a study; for, by taking the card, the
dealer, contrary to all precedent, had forced himself to
lose!</p>
<p>Humpty Green decided that Moses Flood had made a
mistake.</p>
<p>The good luck seemed to encourage Kendall. He
placed another bet&mdash;and won. He doubled the amount,
and won again. He moved bet and payment to the corner
of a card, and said in tones tremulous despite him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes both ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whispered the turn&mdash;it was followed by a rap from
the cuekeeper.</p>
<p>The latter&rsquo;s face was now livid from uprising excitement,
and his eyes like glowing coals. There could be
but one meaning to what he saw&mdash;Moses Flood was indeed
dealing a &ldquo;brace game,&rdquo; but he was dealing it
against himself, and forcing Cecil Kendall to win! With
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
form quivering in his chair, the menial looked at the master.
He might as well have looked at the ceiling.</p>
<p>To Kendall it seemed like the interposition of fate.
The spirit of fortune inspired him. He observed that his
last bet topped the limit, yet he had not been stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How high can I go?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, looking up
at the dealer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till I call you down,&rdquo; answered Flood, with unmoved
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, or I&rsquo;ll break you,&rdquo; laughed Kendall nervously,
his face flushed, his eyes glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot break me,&rdquo; replied Flood, with calm
gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much can I win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question came with strangely abrupt eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety thousand dollars,&rdquo; was the nonchalant rejoinder.</p>
<p>A momentary pallor swept over Kendall&rsquo;s face at the
mention of the sum, and his glittering eyes flashed for an
instant on Flood; but the latter&rsquo;s countenance, void of
insinuation, was as cold and calm as a sea of ice. The
player&rsquo;s brow darkened slightly, and his lips became
drawn in the intensity of his mental action. Had he
known what the humpback, shaking in his chair, knew
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
at that moment, he would have won the sum in half-a-dozen
turns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; he cried to himself. &ldquo;What would that be to
me! it would place me on my feet again! It would
make me a man again&mdash;a man worthy of life and of her!
God above, is it possible to win it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw a possibility, one chance in a hundred, and
took it. He was well worthy his reputation of a high-roller.
Down he went upon the layout with his chips;
now betting one, now two, now three hundred dollars on
a card.</p>
<p>The chips before him gathered like Arctic snow. One,
two, three thousand dollars was passed&mdash;and yet he won.
His face burned as from fever. He was on fire within.
He could scarcely comprehend what was taking place, but
that it was was sufficient; and a fervent hope, banishing
sober contemplation, urged him on. He pressed his bets
from two to three, and from three to five hundred, yet
Moses Flood never spoke. He was glad to see him do
so, for the other players, astounded by the seeming run
of luck, were beginning to follow Kendall.</p>
<p>The silence, oppressive in its intensity, was broken only
by the occasional rap of the cuekeeper and the labored
breathing of the sleeping youth upon the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last turn,&rdquo; said the humpback suddenly, his voice
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
deep and husky in his throat. &ldquo;An ace, five, and seven
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, for the first time during the deal, did Moses
Flood glance at the cue-rack, and raising his eyes, like
stars in his stoical face, he gave its keeper a look of
such intensity that the fellow fairly shuddered in his
chair. It was a command of silence which he dared not
disobey.</p>
<p>Cecil Kendall placed his bets, and Flood made the
turn.</p>
<p>The cues were right, despite the fact that six cards
had been taken, and the humpback breathed a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>Something like an exclamation of triumph, half suppressed,
broke from Kendall&rsquo;s lips. He had called the
turn and emptied the check-rack.</p>
<p>The recreant cashier of the Milmore Trust Company
had won twenty thousand dollars on the deal.</p>
<p>He had experienced a wonderful turn of luck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />A STARTLING SEQUENCE.</h2>
<p>As the deal ended, a deep sigh of relief rose from the
several players at the table, as from men long submerged
in water. Their suppressed excitement had been intense,
fairly painful at times, and this halt between the deals was
a welcome respite.</p>
<p>Except Moses Flood and the deformed cuekeeper,
only one man in the room saw what Moses Flood was
doing. Before the deal was half out, Nick Carter detected
the gamester&rsquo;s design, as well as the marvelous
dexterity with which it was executed. And Nick readily
guessed, too, the true occasion for it. Once more he
leaned nearer to Chick and said softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what Flood is doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that Kendall is winning,&rdquo; whispered Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a race-horse. You are witnessing a bit of unselfish
work that places Flood in a class all his own,&rdquo;
murmured Nick, with some feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dealing so as to insure himself a loser, and
forcing Kendall to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce you say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mark me, Chick,&rdquo; added Nick. &ldquo;He will make
Kendall win a sum sufficient to square him at the bank&mdash;ninety
thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; muttered Chick. &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do about Kendall in that case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be governed by what I observe,&rdquo; whispered
Nick. &ldquo;Be careful to give no sign that we are wise to
anything. This is one of the most extraordinary episodes
I ever witnessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what object can Flood have in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! I can guess what it is, and for all the world
I would not get in his way. I will explain it to you
later. No more now, Chick. They&rsquo;re off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood again had shuffled and stripped the cards, then
placed them in the deal box. Looking at his coldly
stoical face, one would have said that he was utterly
unconscious of his losses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have emptied the chip-rack, Kendall,&rdquo; said he
deliberately. &ldquo;Count me back twenty thousand dollars&rsquo;
worth of your chips. I will note the sum, and pay you
at the end of your play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no fear that the player would quit on the
strength of such a proposition. He knew him too well&mdash;and
his dire need to win more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose my good luck continues?&rdquo; said Kendall
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is not likely,&rdquo; said Flood calmly. &ldquo;But you
shall have all that you can win. I think you know me to
be a man of my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall would have preferred to have the money, but
he offered no further objection. He returned the chips
desired, and Flood made a memorandum of the amount.</p>
<p>Then the next deal began. It was a repetition
of the former, save that now and then, in order to keep
the other players in check, Flood was compelled to let
Kendall lose. But the latter won heavily on the deal as
a whole, his bets being pressed to four figures, and when
the final turn was made he had forty-five thousand dollars
due him from the bank.</p>
<p>The intense strain to which Moses Flood was subjecting
himself was beginning to tell on him. His teeth were
hard set. The muscles of his jaw were rigid, and the
veins about his temples were purple and swollen. The
pupils of his dilated eyes were like points of electric
light.</p>
<p>Despite his efforts to the contrary, other players were
beginning to win by his manipulation of the cards, and
Flood felt that the play must be brought to an end. As
he dealt the cards and put them in the box for the third
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
deal, he decided upon the surest and speediest method.
He sized the chips in front of Kendall, then made a rapid
turn.</p>
<p>One double was in the box. Kendall staked a
thousand.</p>
<p>He won his bet fairly, and Flood lost six hundred to
the other players. He bit his lip as he paid the bets.</p>
<p>Then he glanced down at the next turn to come, and
saw that Kendall was destined to lose. The outsiders
also were upon the card to win, following fortune&rsquo;s
favorite. Moses Flood could have won all the bet by
making an honest turn. Instead, he took a card&mdash;and
lost all.</p>
<p>He paid the bets without a change of countenance&mdash;then
sat back in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this memorandum and the chips in front of
you,&rdquo; said he, looking across at Kendall, &ldquo;I owe you
forty-five thousand dollars. You may bet the entire
amount on a case card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the objection to continuing as we&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;
cried Kendall, aghast at the offer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing well
enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s cold features underwent no change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may make the bet suggested, Kendall, or come
down to the limit,&rdquo; he said firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot get even by that,&rdquo; growled Kendall sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can you win so rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your proposition goes, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say in this place always goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall sat silent for several moments. He already
had won half of the sum he so direfully needed, but he
could not believe that fortune would favor him much
longer. He was a ruined man when he entered the place,
and with only half the desired sum he still was ruined.
To win the bet suggested meant to him&mdash;redemption.
There was no alternative but to accept the offer.</p>
<p>Flood knew absolutely how Kendall would size up the
situation, that he would take this one chance to square
himself. He was not surprised, therefore, when the
latter cried hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me all of your chips,&rdquo; said Flood calmly.</p>
<p>Kendall stacked them upon the layout.</p>
<p>Flood transferred them to the chip-rack, then tossed
a marker, a small, square piece of ivory, across the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That goes for forty-five thousand, Kendall,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Bet it on any card you please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>A hush like that of a death chamber fell over the
room.</p>
<p>A fortune was to hang on the turn of a single card.</p>
<p>Not another man placed a bet.</p>
<p>The color of the marker, white, seemed to give nerve to
Cecil Kendall. If it had been a black one, he would have
shrunk and hesitated. As it was, he played a three-time
loser to win, tossing the marker upon the card, and then
sat back in his chair, half fainting, and waited the turn
that was to decide his fate.</p>
<p>The excitement was intense, utterly indescribable, yet
not a sound broke the deathly stillness.</p>
<p>Moses Flood alone appeared to be calm&mdash;but the condition
was external only. He leaned a little forward, that
he might look down on the box on which every eye was
focused, and anticipated each coming turn.</p>
<p>He made one turn and there was no decision of the
enormous bet. He then made another, a third, a fourth,
and still there was no decision.</p>
<p>Then he hesitated.</p>
<p>Kendall was breathless. His eyes were fixed, staring
wildly at the deal box, and his teeth were chattering. He
was like a man yearning for pardon even under the
muzzles of guns that hung upon the command to fire.</p>
<p>Could he endure the suspense? Would reason sustain
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
the strain? Or would he suddenly reach forward and
withdraw the bet?</p>
<p>Looking down upon the deal box, Moses Flood saw the
coming turn.</p>
<p>He saw that Kendall was fated to lose his bet.</p>
<p>Despite his iron will, Flood began to tremble. To
accomplish his sublime object, he was obliged to take a
false card. Could he do it in his present state and
under the glance of every eye? He ground his teeth, knit
his heavy brows, and the blood in the arteries of his neck
seemed as if to burst its confines.</p>
<p>Still he hesitated&mdash;then the gong on the door broke the
awful silence.</p>
<p>Every eye turned involuntarily toward the bell.</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s hands moved with lightning like rapidity.
They took the false card undetected. The turn was made&mdash;and
Cecil Kendall had won!</p>
<p>He leaped to his feet, caught blindly at his chair, then
cried wildly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more! Not another bet! Not for life itself will I
make another bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood rose, with face fairly transfigured, and pointed
to the sleeping man on the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; he sternly commanded, with a voice that
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
silenced all. &ldquo;Do not wake young Royal. He is in no
shape to go home to his father and sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter leaned over and gripped Chick hard by the
wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods, Chick,&rdquo; he muttered huskily, &ldquo;from
this hour my money goes on Moses Flood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not strange, this feeling on the part of the great
detective, for he, at least, knew what Moses Flood had
done, and why he had done it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let there be no disturbance here,&rdquo; said Flood, now
quite calmly. &ldquo;John, go and answer the bell. And you,
Mr. Kendall, come into my private room, and I will pay
your winnings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kendall tried to speak, but his voice died in his swelling
throat.</p>
<p>The man who had rung the bell was the returning
dealer, Tom Bruce.</p>
<p>Flood beckoned him to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continue the game, Mr. Bruce,&rdquo; said he gravely.
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I do not wish the episode of this evening to
be noised abroad, and those of you who are my friends
will govern yourselves accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll keep mum about it, Mose!&rdquo; cried several
promptly.</p>
<p>As Flood passed the humpback, who was replacing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
bar on the door, he laid his hand on the man&rsquo;s shoulder
and said softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word of this, John, for your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses Flood knew that he could trust him, and he
believed that no other man on earth knew what he had
done there that night. He locked the brace deal box in
the drawer from which he had taken it, but kept the
deck of strippers in his hand when he led Cecil Kendall
into his private room.</p>
<p>As the door closed upon the two men, Nathan Godard
sauntered nearer to Bruce and said carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to supper, Tom. I have one or two
errands to do, and may be out a bit longer than usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Nate,&rdquo; nodded Bruce, who had taken his
seat at the table. &ldquo;Do not hurry back, as the boss said
that he was going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return in about an hour,&rdquo; added Godard.</p>
<p>Then he took his hat and departed.</p>
<p>Neither Nick Carter nor Chick observed him.</p>
<p>The eyes of both were fixed upon the closed door of
Flood&rsquo;s private room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />THE WAGES OF SIN.</h2>
<p>In the private room to which he had led him, Moses
Flood paid Kendall his winnings. As he took a portion
of the funds from a huge safe in one corner, he said
coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must give you part of the amount in government
bonds, Mr. Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything&mdash;anything easily convertible,&rdquo; faltered Kendall,
half choked with emotion.</p>
<p>He could hardly realize what had befallen him, that he
really had won all that he required to rectify his deficit
at the bank, and that he then and there was to receive
the money that would save him from flight, a defaulter&rsquo;s
last resort, or the shame of a convict&rsquo;s cell.</p>
<p>He feared each moment that he would awake, that he
would find it all a dream, and behold again the soul-sickening
image of his dreadful crime leering at him
with mocking eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The package will be quite bulky, and I will loan you a
small portmanteau,&rdquo; said Flood, placing the satchel mentioned
and several bundles of bank-notes and bonds upon
the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Kendall tottered nearer, then suddenly gave way to
sobs and covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God! God above!&rdquo; he cried brokenly. &ldquo;Flood,
you do not know, you cannot know, what this means to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses Flood drew himself up and laid his hand on the
speaker&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kendall,&rdquo; said he, with grave austerity, &ldquo;you are not
rightly tempered to be a gamester. Take the advice of a
gamester, however, and for the sake of those who love
you, if not for your own, never again face a faro layout
or play a card for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never, so help me God!&rdquo; cried Kendall, with
uplifted hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you adhere to that vow, I shall not feel to-night
that I have suffered any loss,&rdquo; said Flood, with a strange
light upon his white, forceful face.</p>
<p>Then he tossed into the satchel the deck of cards with
which he had dealt the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall give you those cards also, Kendall,&rdquo; said he
oddly. &ldquo;They are the ones I have been using. Keep
them until I come and demand them of you. Some day
you may know why I ask you to do this. Some day I
may wish to recall to your mind what I to-night have&mdash;&mdash; Ah,
but it does not matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will keep them,&rdquo; declared Kendall fervently. &ldquo;God
hearing me, I will keep them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood had already closed and tightly strapped the
satchel, which he now hastened to place in Kendall&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pledge my word that the amount is right,&rdquo; he said,
with some feeling. &ldquo;Now go as quickly as you can,
and remember your promise! Go&mdash;go&mdash;and remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still profoundly agitated, Kendall hurried from the
room, ignoring all observers, forgetful even of his sleeping
friend upon the couch, and thus hastened alone from
the house and sought the cool air of the early evening.</p>
<p>Nick Carter saw him emerge from the room, and Chick
leaned nearer, saying softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I shadow him, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The famous detective shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Chick,&rdquo; said he quietly. &ldquo;There is no need of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel assured. The man&rsquo;s face tells the story. He
is, indeed, short at the bank, but he will use this money to
make good the deficit and conceal his crime. I am as
sure of it as if I saw it done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick was entirely correct as to Kendall&rsquo;s intentions,
and, recalling Gilsey&rsquo;s instructions, he saw no occasion
to go beyond them. He was thinking, too, of Dora Royal,
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
of the promise he had made her, and of what Flood that
night had done, believing it to be for her sake. Now,
feeling sure of his man, Nick would not for the world
have perverted the design and desires of Moses Flood.</p>
<p>The latter again appeared upon the scene while Nick
was speaking, and at the same moment the sound of a
heavy fall started all hearers. It was almost immediately
followed by a maudlin laugh, and the man who had been
so long sleeping on the couch was seen rising unsteadily
from the floor beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! I reckon I fell out of bed,&rdquo; he cried, in half-drunken
tones, as he gained his feet and stared with
dazed eyes toward the group of players at the table.</p>
<p>Though nearly twenty-three Harry Royal looked to be
little more than a youth. When sober, he was a handsome
fellow, yet his features indicated a weak and yielding
nature, and he was no sooner loosed from the restrictions
of his home life to attend college than he proved
an easy victim to the temptations which had brought
him to his present condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are they coming, Kendall?&rdquo; he continued, swaying
unsteadily and failing to observe that his friend had
departed. &ldquo;Are you winning our expenses? Have
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he caught sight of Flood approaching, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
reeled toward him with extended hand, crying boisterously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mose, old man! Glad to see you, on my word
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am sorry to see you, Royal, in this condition,&rdquo;
Flood gravely rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faugh! Cut that out, Mose,&rdquo; cried Royal, flushing
slightly and shaking his head to clear it of the cobwebs.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only now and then, old man. We are just back
from Beantown, Kendall and I, and winding up a devil&rsquo;s
own racket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We painted Boston crimson, Mose, on my word. I
say, Kendall, how are the cards winning? I&rsquo;m in with
this play, old chap, win or lose. Partners&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words broke involuntarily from Flood, with a look
of sudden dismay, but the humpback hastened to cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Mr. Royal, you&rsquo;re not! Kendall went broke
on your mutual play, I give you my word. You were
not in with the last&mdash;you were asleep when he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie! I am in with him!&rdquo; Royal angrily interrupted.
&ldquo;Where has he gone? The devil take him, he
treats me like a schoolboy. I say I was in with his play.
Did he win? Tell me, did he win?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Before Flood could respond, one of the players cried a
bit derisively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not, Harry! Only a cool ninety thousand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of Harry Royal grew dark as a thunder-cloud.
He at once suspected that Kendall had proven false, and
was bent upon cheating him of a part of the winnings, an
idea somewhat warranted by the latter&rsquo;s apparently secret
departure. The possibility of thus being wronged seemed
to arouse the very worst passions of which the intoxicated
young man was capable. With a scream of rage, he
darted to the couch and seized his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety thousand&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve heard him say he meant
to jump the country!&rdquo; he cried wildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my
share of it, Mose. Do you hear me&mdash;I was in with his
play! He means to do me&mdash;curse him; but I know where
to find him! I&rsquo;ll have my half, or I&rsquo;ll have his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; thundered Flood, with terrible sternness. &ldquo;Do
you know where you are and what you are saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go&mdash;let go my arm!&rdquo; frothed the frenzied youth,
struggling furiously in the other&rsquo;s grasp. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know him as I do. I know where to find him&mdash;he has
an appointment to-night with my&mdash;&mdash; Let go, I say! If
he is not at the rectory, he means to swindle me. Let go,
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
Mose; or I&rsquo;ll strike you! I will have what&rsquo;s coming to
me, or I&rsquo;ll have his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the infuriated words ringing from his lips he
wrenched himself free, and before he could be prevented
he had thrown down the bar from across the door and
fled like a madman down the hall stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wayward fool!&rdquo; exclaimed Flood, thoroughly disgusted,
yet anticipating no serious results from the passionate
threats. &ldquo;He is a crazy ass when in liquor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bruce, I am going out for about an hour. If he returns
before I come in, ask him to wait for me. I have
a few words of advice for his foolish ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange place is a faro-bank. The excitement had
passed, and the game was again in progress. Not a man
had moved from his seat at the table.</p>
<p>With features in no way betraying his feelings, Moses
Flood put on his coat and hat, took a heavy, ironwood
cane from a stand in one corner, and signed for Green to
accompany him to the door. On the threshold he paused
for a moment, fixing his piercing eyes upon those of
the humpback, and said, barely above his breath, yet with
indescribable intensity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, John! Not one word!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never, sir; so help me God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Flood was gone, and the door closed with a bang.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Nick Carter, who had not deemed
it worth his while to interfere, which step might have
suggested his identity, signed for Chick to accompany
him, and they left the place together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing more for us there,&rdquo; remarked
Nick, as they headed for home. &ldquo;If ever a man in a bad
corner made a lucky play, Kendall has made one this
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if I can see through it!&rdquo; said Chick, perplexedly.
&ldquo;What has come over Flood that he should
do such a thing as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sentiment which quite often brings out the very
best part of a man,&rdquo; replied Nick gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we get home, Chick, and I will then explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; laughed Chick. &ldquo;I reckon I can wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seated together in the library of Nick&rsquo;s residence, half-an-hour
later, the latter took up the subject where he
had dropped it on the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Nick, lighting a cigar. &ldquo;And
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
it&rsquo;s just what I would have expected of Mose Flood.
He&rsquo;s as odd a man as stands in leather. As grand a
man, too, barring his one deplorable vice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a legion of friends, Nick, there&rsquo;s no doubt
of that,&rdquo; observed Chick. &ldquo;You say that he is in love
with Doctor Royal&rsquo;s daughter, eh? Was that what led to
his move of to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; nodded Nick. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a curious side to
the affair, however. Flood has never told the girl of his
love, and he has no idea that she cares for him. He took
the rector&rsquo;s word for it this afternoon that she loves
Kendall and is engaged to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some way, Chick, he must have learned that Kendall
is short in his accounts to the tune of ninety thousand
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he forced Kendall to win that amount, knowing
that he would use it to square himself? Was that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he not give Kendall the money openly,
without compelling him to make a play for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several reasons, all characteristic of Moses Flood.
First, he aimed to insure that Dora Royal should never
learn of Kendall&rsquo;s crime, or that he had saved him in
this way for her sake. He does not want the girl to
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
feel under obligations to him. Possibly he feared that
she might object to her lover&rsquo;s accepting money from
a gambler, even to keep him out of jail. Second, he
aimed to spare Kendall the shame of knowing that his
crime had been discovered, or was at least suspected. So
he forced him to win the money, instead of giving it to
him openly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! that was good of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just like him, Chick. He has saved this man
for love of that girl, and it cost him ninety thousand
dollars to do it, with never a possibility that his magnanimity
would be discovered, or that a word of gratitude
would ever be given him. Chick, such a man as
that is worthy of any girl, whether she&rsquo;s a clergyman&rsquo;s
daughter or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope he gets her,&rdquo; cried Chick bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; smiled Nick significantly. &ldquo;I reckon
I yet may have a finger in this pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now see why you did not wish to arrest Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not, Chick. I am convinced that Kendall will
use that money to adjust his affairs at the bank. Feeling
sure of that, I determined not to pervert Flood&rsquo;s lofty
design, on which he had plainly set his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His cuekeeper must have known what came off?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;The humpback?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; admitted Nick, &ldquo;but Flood evidently
knows that he can trust him to say nothing about it.
Furthermore, Chick, the cuekeeper is probably entirely
ignorant of Flood&rsquo;s motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one feature of the case,&rdquo; added Nick, rather
more grimly, &ldquo;concerning which I am very much in the
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the dickens did Flood learn that Kendall was
short at the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! that&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we have not heard the last of the case, Chick,
and that something serious may yet result from it. There
is no evading one fact, however. Flood has a heart as
big as that of an ox, since he would thus save a man
for the sake of a girl he himself loves, instead of jealously
knocking his pins from under him. In days to come I&rsquo;ll
not forget this in Moses Flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very next morning, which was sooner than Nick
expected, his prediction concerning the outcome of the
case was startlingly verified. He was seated with Chick
in his office, about eight o&rsquo;clock, when a district telegraph
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
boy brought in a message. Nick tore it open and read it,
then leaped involuntarily to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Nick?&rdquo; demanded Chick impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wages of sin is death!&rdquo; cried Nick, with thrilling
accents. &ldquo;This message is from Dora Royal, asking
me to come at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cecil Kendall was found murdered in the rectory
grounds this morning!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />BY WHOSE HAND?</h2>
<p>Recalling the promise given Medora Royal, and now
feeling a decided interest in the case itself, Nick Carter
at once hastened to Fordham, and approached the rectory
just before nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The news of the crime had spread, and at one of the
side gates a curious crowd had gathered, restrained from
entering the grounds by one of the local police.</p>
<p>Near the house, and at some distance from the street,
was a group of men, including several officers and a
physician, also the rector himself, all apparently interested
in the doctor&rsquo;s examination of a body lying upon the
ground at their feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>That Doctor Royal was among them, rather than in the
house, suited Nick to the letter. Slipping into a disguise,
that he might not thus early be identified with the case,
Nick hastened to the adjoining cross-street on which
the dwelling fronted. There he encountered none to
oppose his entrance, and he strode quickly up the long
gravel walk and rang the door-bell.</p>
<p>The summons brought Dora Royal to the door, and
Nick, observing her shrink with surprise, quickly made
himself known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come in response to your telegram, Miss Royal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am,&rdquo; interposed Nick significantly. &ldquo;I do
not wish to be recognized by others, however. I want a
word with you alone, that I may add to the instructions
I gave you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now convinced of his identity, Medora Royal hastened
to admit him to a reception-room, the door of which Nick
quietly closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our interview must be very brief, Miss Royal, for I
wish to have a look at the evidence out yonder before
it is seriously disturbed,&rdquo; said he, declining a chair.
&ldquo;First, however, state anything that you know of the
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know but very little, sir, save that it is most dreadful,&rdquo;
said the girl, pale and agitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, Miss Royal, but I wish to get at the
superficial facts as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will question me, sir, perhaps I more readily
can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; interposed Nick, appreciating her nervous
excitement. &ldquo;Tell me when and by whom the body
was discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About eight o&rsquo;clock, sir, and by a young man who is
employed here as a gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that of Cecil Kendall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many hours, surely. He appears to have been
killed with a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for my questions, please,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Was
Kendall here in the house last evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my father, myself, and two servants,&rdquo; replied
Dora. &ldquo;We all retired soon after nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not yet returned from Boston. That is, sir,
unless&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what, Miss Royal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless he arrived in New York yesterday, and remained
at his room in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably that is what he did,&rdquo; nodded Nick,
both to relieve the girl and conceal his own misgivings.
&ldquo;Where is his room in town, Miss Royal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Carleton Chambers. He prefers to keep a
room there, rather than come out each night from college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; bowed Nick. &ldquo;Now tell me, has your father
said anything to you about his interview with Moses
Flood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one word, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have had no callers here since yesterday
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, Detective Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly do not mention my name, Miss Royal,&rdquo; smiled
Nick. &ldquo;Even the walls may have ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be more guarded, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you are still willing to follow my advice, I
wish to add to my instructions,&rdquo; said Nick, now having
learned the important facts which she could impart to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am more than anxious to do so,&rdquo; Dora answered
feelingly. &ldquo;Your immediate response to my telegram
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
convinces me that you have my welfare at heart, and I
will be rigidly governed by your instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will ultimately prove to your advantage,&rdquo; said
Nick earnestly. &ldquo;I shall leave no stone unturned to
bring about that which is dearest to you. This murder,
however, if such it is, threatens to create serious complications,
and it will very possibly circumstantially incriminate
innocent parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, is it possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let come what may, Miss Royal, I want you to trust
the case entirely to me, and do exactly what I advise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under no circumstances are you to mention me in
connection with the case, nor disclose our relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, whatever happens, or whoever appears
to be involved, you must volunteer no opinion of the
case. If you are questioned, however, answer precisely
the same as if you had not overheard your father&rsquo;s interview
with Moses Flood, and as if you and I had never
met. Will you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may safely leave all the rest to me,&rdquo; declared
Nick warmly. &ldquo;By whom did you send the telegram
this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;By our chambermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know to whom it was addressed, or of what
it consisted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, sir. I sent it to the telegraph office under
seal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Nick approvingly. &ldquo;Be equally
guarded in the future, or till I further advise you. This
must be all for the present, Miss Royal, as I wish to
make a few investigations outside. I will leave by the
front door and pass around the house, that our interview
here may not be suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how am I to repay you, or thank you for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By following my instructions to the letter,&rdquo; Nick
gently interposed, as he led the troubled girl into the
hall. &ldquo;Keep them constantly in mind and trust me to
be constantly alert to your interests. No more now, Miss
Royal. You shall hear from me later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last was said at the open door, and with the final
word Nick nodded and smiled encouragingly, then left
the veranda and quickly made his way around the house.</p>
<p>The interview had occupied but a very few minutes,
and as Nick approached the group of men gathered near
Kendall&rsquo;s body, the physician was just about concluding
his examination of the remains.</p>
<p>With a few rapid glances Nick took in the superficial
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
evidence bearing upon the crime. The body lay upon
the greensward to the right of a gravel walk leading
around the house, and nearly midway between the walk
and the library windows. The plot of grass between the
walk and the house was about ten feet wide, and Nick
promptly deduced one important point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no door on this side of the house, nor any
direct approach to one from either gate,&rdquo; he quickly
reasoned. &ldquo;Evidently Kendall came around here to peer
through the library window before entering the house,
and was struck down as he approached, or while quietly
withdrawing. For some reason he must have aimed to
learn who was within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A glance at the gravel walk and the greensward near-by,
however, gave Nick no clue. If Kendall&rsquo;s assailant
had left any telltale footprints behind him, both his own
and those that might have revealed the movements of
his victim had been obliterated by the heavy tread of
the several men gathered about the murdered man.</p>
<p>The body evidently lay where it had fallen, with arms
outstretched and face upturned, gory and ghastly in the
morning sunlight. The skull had been fractured by several
blows with a heavy weapon, obviously a bludgeon
of some kind, and from the shocking wounds the blood
had oozed over the brow and hair of the stricken man,
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
forming a sickening pool in the matted grass on which
his head rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clad just as he was when he left Flood&rsquo;s gambling-house,&rdquo;
thought Nick. &ldquo;He must have come directly
out here. There&rsquo;s no sign of the satchel, however, in
which he had brought away his winnings. It looks as
if the motive was robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nick recalled the frenzied threats of young Harry
Royal, but decided it was too early in the game to draw
any reliable conclusions.</p>
<p>Nick reverted almost immediately to the physician,
who had risen while wiping his soiled hands, and now
addressed his several companions. Three of these were
officers of the local police, among them Captain Talbot,
of the precinct station, and one was a plain-clothes man
from the central office, Detective Joe Gerry.</p>
<p>Nick knew all of them very well, and they him, yet
for the present he preferred to hide his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case of murder, Detective Gerry, that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo;
declared the physician, turning to the central office man.
&ldquo;The question is, By whose hand was the crime committed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has he been dead?&rdquo; demanded Gerry
bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twelve hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would be since nine o&rsquo;clock last evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hits very near to it,&rdquo; replied the physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure of this man&rsquo;s identity, Doctor Royal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positively,&rdquo; cried the rector, obviously much agitated.
&ldquo;He has been a frequent visitor here. I cannot comprehend
how such a fate could have befallen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that the motive appears to be obscure,&rdquo;
replied Gerry, staring down at the body. &ldquo;It cannot have
been robbery, for neither his jewelry nor his pocketbook
has been taken. No, no, the motive cannot have been
robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll change your mind, Gerry, when you learn
that this man won ninety thousand dollars just before
coming out here,&rdquo; said Nick to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are some of your men searching the grounds for evidence,
Talbot?&rdquo; inquired Gerry, turning to the captain
of police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, several of them,&rdquo; nodded Captain Talbot.</p>
<p>The detective reverted to Doctor Royal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you at home last evening?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; bowed the rector. &ldquo;Both my daughter and
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have any callers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, sir. We were alone all the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;In what part of the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the library, sir, from dinner until after nine
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the library located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the windows, sir, right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Gerry. &ldquo;Is that so? It looks as
if this man had designed to peer into them, and had been
caught in the act, if not done up for it. Possibly we
may find a motive for the crime by looking a little deeper.
You say that this man Kendall was a friend of your
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter saw what was coming, yet he made no
move to head it off. His immediate design was only to
observe the trend of the case, and then shape his own
course accordingly.</p>
<p>Doctor Royal grew even more pale upon hearing the
remarks of the central office man, and he fell to wringing
his hands with a sort of nervous apprehension. He was
thinking of his son, who for several days had been absent
with Kendall, and had not yet returned.</p>
<p>Yet there lay Cecil Kendall, slain by the hand of an
assassin, and the unaccountable absence of Harry Royal
still remained to be explained.</p>
<p>The mystery of it all dismayed the worthy clergyman,
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
yet, despite his desperate misgivings, he nerved himself to
answer quite firmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Mr. Kendall has been a friend of my family
for several years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you expecting a visit from him last evening?&rdquo;
asked Gerry, with a keen eye to the rector&rsquo;s perturbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say that I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he called here frequently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Doctor Royal, what were his precise relations
here?&rdquo; demanded Gerry suspiciously. &ldquo;You appear
averse to letting go of something. If you know of
any facts that may shed a ray of light upon this case,
let&rsquo;s have them at once. I&rsquo;m sure that you personally
can have no reason for hiding anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; cried Doctor Royal, with extreme
nervousness. &ldquo;I would give the world to know the truth
of this dreadful affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of Kendall, then, and his relations here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;really&mdash;as a matter of fact, he was in love with
my daughter,&rdquo; faltered the rector, trembling visibly. &ldquo;In
a word, Detective Gerry, he was about the same as engaged
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! Then it&rsquo;s barely possible that jealousy led
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
some party to kill him,&rdquo; cried Gerry, quickly snapping up
the clue. &ldquo;Has your daughter any other admirer who
might be guilty of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;really I can name no one who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit!&rdquo; cried Captain Talbot abruptly. &ldquo;Here
comes Kelly on the run. By thunder, I believe he has
the weapon with which the crime was committed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every eye was quickly turned in the direction indicated.</p>
<p>Along a path leading around the stable and to a gate
at the rear of the extensive grounds a policeman was
hurriedly approaching, holding above his head what appeared
to be a stout stick. As he drew near, however, it
was seen to be a heavy cane, highly polished, and with a
round silver head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you there, Kelly?&rdquo; cried Detective Gerry
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See for yourself, sir,&rdquo; replied the officer. &ldquo;I found it
thrust beneath a lot of brushwood under the wall at
the rear of the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective uttered a cry as he seized it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! it&rsquo;s covered with blood,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And
see! here are bits of scalp and hair dried on the side and
head of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;His hair!&rdquo; cried Talbot, pointing to the lifeless man
near-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it&mdash;not a shadow of doubt!&rdquo; exclaimed
Gerry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the weapon with which the deed was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Nick Carter was a little startled, as well as a good
deal puzzled.</p>
<p>For Nick had almost instantly recognized the cane.
It was the same that Nick had seen Moses Flood take
from a rack just before leaving his gambling-house at
half-past eight the previous evening.</p>
<p>Over the face of Doctor Leonard Royal there had
come an expression not easily described. It was that of
sudden and overwhelming relief, mingled with convictions
and a bitterness that scarce had bounds. He no
longer was restrained by apprehensions concerning his
son, and the latter&rsquo;s unaccountable absence, for he now
believed that he read aright the appalling evidence before
him. With a cry of bitter condemnation he sprang
forward and laid his hand on Detective Gerry&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the knave! the knave!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in tones
that startled all hearers. &ldquo;I now see it all. I should
have known it&mdash;I should have known it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Doctor Royal, what are you saying?&rdquo;
demanded Gerry, involuntarily drawing back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;That cane&mdash;it belongs to Moses Flood,&rdquo; cried the
rector, pointing wildly at the gory stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Moses Flood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him carry it countless times,&rdquo; cried the
excited clergyman. &ldquo;You are right&mdash;you are right!
Jealousy was the motive for this crime. The cane belongs
to Moses Flood, and only yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Moses Flood, the gambler?&rdquo; interrupted
Gerry, in tones that began to ring with exultant convictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same&mdash;the same!&rdquo; cried Doctor Royal. &ldquo;Only
yesterday I scornfully refused him the hand of my daughter,
and told him she was already engaged to Cecil Kendall.
Jealousy must have been the motive. Flood must
be the guilty party. Only yesterday I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens, then, Flood is the man we want!&rdquo; exclaimed
Gerry, again interrupting the pale and excited
rector.</p>
<p>Nick Carter could see only too plainly the result of the
discoveries made there that morning, and he did not wait
to hear more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flood, eh?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Not by a long chalk.
Cane or no cane, Moses Flood never killed this man.
It&rsquo;s plainly time for me to get in a bit of lively work,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
and head off this man Gerry. He&rsquo;ll now go at the case
like a bull at a gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he turned from the scene, bent upon hastening
away, Nick caught sight of a white, frightened face at
one of the library windows&mdash;the face of the girl from
whom he had recently parted, and who plainly had seen
and heard all.</p>
<p>Darting around a corner of the house, Nick rapped
smartly on one of the side windows. The sound quickly
brought Dora Royal to him, and he signed for her to raise
the sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be alarmed,&rdquo; he then cried softly. &ldquo;Your face
will betray you unless you conceal your feelings. Did
you hear all that was said out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, every word,&rdquo; moaned the girl breathlessly.
&ldquo;Oh, oh, it cannot be possible! He never did it&mdash;he
could not have done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my word for that, Miss Royal, and suppress
your fears,&rdquo; Nick hurriedly answered. &ldquo;Let the evidence
be what it may, never believe that Flood committed that
crime. I have no time for more. Be guarded, constantly
guarded, and follow my every instruction to the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely will, sir. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to queer the move against Moses Flood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />UNDER OATH.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I propose to do, Chick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the bottom of it, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plumb to the bottom,&rdquo; declared the famous detective.
&ldquo;I am now in the case in dead earnest, Chick, and I&rsquo;m
going to know who killed that man Kendall or lose a leg
in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager you&rsquo;ll retain both legs,&rdquo; laughed Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave my word to that Royal girl when I believed
there appeared nothing very serious in the way of making
good my promise, and now that I find myself confronted
with the most serious of all problems, I&rsquo;m blessed if
I&rsquo;ll throw up the sponge. I&rsquo;ll ferret out the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. You hear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick laughed again, and he was by no means blind to
the grim determination reflected in Nick&rsquo;s face, nor to the
feelings with which his words were imbued.</p>
<p>It was less than an hour since Nick left the scene of
the murder committed the previous night, and he had
hurried home to rejoin Chick and inform him of all he
had seen and heard.</p>
<p>With Nick Carter to think was to act, yet despite his
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
hurried return from Fordham, and the fact that he was
now very definitely actuated, Nick was not a little puzzled
by the conflicting evidence of the case.</p>
<p>It was this evidence that he was discussing with Chick,
which had led to the foregoing digression, while Nick
was rapidly putting on the same disguise that he had
worn in Flood&rsquo;s place the previous evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears plain enough that Flood went out there
last night after leaving his faro-bank,&rdquo; Nick grimly continued.
&ldquo;You saw him take that cane just as he departed,
and I can swear it to be the same that was found
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot have gone out there of itself,&rdquo; remarked
Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why Flood went out there again, after having
been turned down by the rector, and making that big
losing to Kendall, is more than I can conjecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard young Royal&rsquo;s threats in the faro-bank,&rdquo;
said Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I heard them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly Flood feared that the drunken scamp meant
to execute them, and he may have gone out there to
prevent him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick quickly shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well enough reasoned, Chick,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but your
theory hasn&rsquo;t feet to stand on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; replied Nick, &ldquo;Flood attached no
serious importance to Royal&rsquo;s threats, and barely gave
them a second thought. His face showed that; also
that his mind was intent upon some other matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that he appeared so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; added Nick, &ldquo;he had only Royal&rsquo;s
maudlin intimation as to where Kendall might be found,
and he would not have banked so heavily on them as to
have traveled post-haste to Fordham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly not, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have gone directly out there, however, for
it was after eight o&rsquo;clock when he left the faro-bank, and
we have the physician&rsquo;s word for it that the murder was
committed about nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Chick, some other motive took Flood out to
Fordham last night, and only the devil himself could
guess just what occurred there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that he killed Kendall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a long chalk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wager all I possess against that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about young Royal?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an open question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s barely possible, yet it is too early in the game
to think profitably,&rdquo; replied Nick. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something I
want you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Royal keeps a room at the Carleton Chambers. Do
you know where they are located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then into a disguise, in order that we may not appear
in the case as yet, and go up there,&rdquo; continued Nick.
&ldquo;If you can find Royal, question him as to where he went
last night after leaving Flood&rsquo;s place, and see what you
can gather from his answers and his bearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that, Nick. But suppose he is away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then quietly ascertain, if possible, whether he occupied
his room there last night, and at precisely what
time he came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All for the present, Chick, as far as he is concerned.
That central office sleuth, Gerry, will get after him soon
enough, as well as after Flood, and I wish at present to
keep a bit in the background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gerry will soon learn all about Kendall&rsquo;s winning
that money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, Chick, but he&rsquo;ll not discover that Flood
lost it voluntarily. You and I and that cuekeeper are all
that know about it, and the humpback will keep his
mouth closed. I&rsquo;ll wager that Flood has insured that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the evidence against Flood is decidedly incriminating,&rdquo;
declared Chick. &ldquo;Gerry will probably land
him this very morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; smiled Nick oddly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
get in the way of Mr. Detective Gerry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho, that&rsquo;s your game, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beginning of it,&rdquo; replied Nick, more
gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced, despite the evidence against
him, that Flood had no hand in this crime. Before I
can proceed to an intelligent investigation of it, however,
I must learn just where Moses Flood stands, and what
attitude he will take when informed of the murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may deny any knowledge of it, or claim that he
was not&mdash;&mdash;Ah, but what&rsquo;s the use of trying to anticipate
Flood&rsquo;s conduct?&rdquo; Nick bluntly demanded. &ldquo;A man
who would do what he did last evening, Chick, would
hesitate at nothing that served his purpose. He&rsquo;s as
difficult to read as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As yourself,&rdquo; supplemented Chick, with a laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly even more difficult,&rdquo; smiled Nick, as he
completed his disguise. &ldquo;At all events, Chick, I&rsquo;m not
quite sure that I want Flood arrested, and so I&rsquo;m going
to get in Gerry&rsquo;s way until I can learn how the land
lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Flood will inform you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that he will, but I believe I can gather
something from an interview with him,&rdquo; explained Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not suspect me, in this disguise, of being other
than a fellow gamester, and I have already shaped my
course with him. Meantime you investigate young Harry
Royal, and meet me here at noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that youngster to me,&rdquo; nodded Chick, as they
prepared to depart, in company. &ldquo;By the way, Nick, have
you communicated with Gilsey, of the Trust Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have telephoned him only that Kendall was in
Flood&rsquo;s place last evening,&rdquo; replied Nick. &ldquo;I could not
well inform him of the murder without disclosing that
I had been out there. He&rsquo;ll get the news of that soon
enough, however. As the case now looks,&rdquo; added the detective,
as they were about parting at the street corner,
&ldquo;I think we may have some warm work before we see
the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let it come, Nick. I reckon we can take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give it a try, at all events. See me again at
noon, Chick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened that morning that Moses Flood arrived at
his gambling-house less than ten minutes in advance of
Nick Carter. It was an hour, moreover, when there
was rarely any business, and Flood found the house deserted
by all except the attendant at the street door and
the deformed cuekeeper on the floor above. Both were
engaged in putting the place in order after the night
game.</p>
<p>Flood at once mounted the stairs and entered the
chamber previously described. At that hour, however,
the room presented a vivid contrast. It was like looking
at the bare stage of a theater seen by daylight. There
was no game going, no excited players, no glare of electric
lights, no clicking of ivory chips, no signs of apprehension,
no precautionary measures. For the door of
the room stood open, and John Green, the humpback,
was engaged in wiping the glassware on the sideboard.</p>
<p>Flood appeared pale and haggard, like one who has
passed a sleepless night; yet he was neatly dressed, as was
always the case, and carried himself with habitual dignity
and composure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, John!&rdquo; said he, with a sharp glance
about the room.</p>
<p>The face of the humpback lighted perceptibly, yet a
certain anxious look in his tired eye betrayed his secret
misgivings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Flood!&rdquo; he replied, a bit huskily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re down early, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhat. Who has been here this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Nate Godard, sir. He looked in for a minute,
then said he had an errand down-town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one else has called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood suppressed a sigh of relief; yet, despite the assurance
given him, his eyes again swept sharply about
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did the game stop last night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about midnight, sir. There weren&rsquo;t many around
after&mdash;after&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I made my big losing?&rdquo; queried the gambler,
with a faint smile crossing his pale face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, sir; that&rsquo;s what I had in mind,&rdquo; replied Green,
with grave humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did young Royal show up again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;You saw what I did, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I help seeing it, Mr. Flood? I had to
mark up the cues when you signed a card taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I do the job well, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sir&mdash;well&rsquo;s no name for it!&rdquo; cried the humpback.
&ldquo;On my word, sir, I was the most surprised man
that ever sat shaking in a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing for you to fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t all fear, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not surprised at anything I may do,&rdquo; added
Flood moodily. &ldquo;Was any person wise to the play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a one, sir,&rdquo; declared Green, with emphasis.
&ldquo;All hands thought the losing was on the level. Not a
man save us knows what you did, Mr. Flood. I&rsquo;d stake
my life on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your life, then, John, keep the secret!&rdquo; cried
Flood, laying a heavy hand on his startled hearer&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;Give me your word, your oath, man, that
you&rsquo;ll keep it, let come what may!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My oath &rsquo;tis, sir, then!&rdquo; cried the humpback, with
his hand impressively raised. &ldquo;So help me God, sir, I&rsquo;ll
keep the secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor reveal it under any circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, sir, until you say the word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;For reasons of my own, John, I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dash your reasons, sir!&rdquo; came the impulsive interruption.
&ldquo;Your wish is enough for me. I&rsquo;ve not forgot
&rsquo;twas you who took me out of the streets and put
me in the way of a decent living. I told you last
night you could trust me. And I tell you now, sir, I&rsquo;ll
let go my life if need be to hide what you did last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood dropped his hand from the man&rsquo;s shoulder and
took that of the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that I can trust you, John,&rdquo; said he slowly.
&ldquo;My only fear was that you might disclose the truth for
my sake, should serious circumstances involve me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, sir, if you say not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand me, John,&rdquo; and Flood&rsquo;s resonant voice
grew strangely hard and grim. &ldquo;I am now playing
against a tough and hard game, the hardest a man ever
has to face, and one that may bring me between life and
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t start and grow pale. I know what I&rsquo;m
about and what I am saying. Mark well my words, and
remember your vow. Under no circumstances, not even
to save my neck from a hangman&rsquo;s noose, are you by
word or sign to betray my secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of the humpback was the color of dead ashes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
and its expression one never to be forgotten. Yet he
again raised his hand and fervently answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, sir, God hearing me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever wish the truth disclosed, I will inform you.
Till then, let come what may, be silent&mdash;always silent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, sir, my lips are sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the gratitude of a man of my calling is worth
anything,&rdquo; added Flood, with a strange light sweeping
over his hueless face, &ldquo;if a gambler&rsquo;s appreciation, a
gamester&rsquo;s thanks&mdash;&mdash;Hush! Not a word! See who
rang&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A single note from the bell on the street door had
sounded through the quiet house.</p>
<p>It caused Flood to start as if stung. His countenance
changed like a flash. His features became hard as flint,
and his eyes, in which were reflected the sad memories
evoking his grateful words, took on a light like that cast
from a blade of polished steel.</p>
<p>The humpback darted into the hall and peered down the
stairs.</p>
<p>The attendant was just opening the street door.</p>
<p>Nick Carter, in the disguise of Joe Badger, stood on the
steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Peters!&rdquo; he exclaimed familiarly, &ldquo;is Moses
Flood about?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>The goggle eyes of the humpback swept round to meet
those of the gamester, standing as rigid as stone in the
adjoining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Joe Badger, sir,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>Again that fleeting expression of relief swept over
Flood&rsquo;s white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badger&mdash;at this hour!&rdquo; he muttered darkly. &ldquo;What
does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he must see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the word, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must! Ha! What matters? Let him come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The humpback called down the stairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Peters! Let him come up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Nick Carter quickly mounted the stairs.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.</h2>
<p>Though not particularly elated over having located
Flood so promptly, Nick Carter felt considerable satisfaction
in that he had accomplished it before Detective
Gerry, who, he expected, might arrive upon the scene
at any moment. That Flood&rsquo;s arrest would immediately
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
follow, unless Nick saw fit to prevent it, the detective
had not a doubt.</p>
<p>The settled paleness of Flood&rsquo;s clean-cut, forceful features
when Nick entered the room was the only outward
sign of his recent brief excitement. He greeted the
disguised detective with a careless nod, saying indifferently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Badger. What brings you here at this
hour? There&rsquo;s seldom anything doing before noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Mose,&rdquo; replied Nick, with a glance about
the room to learn who was there. &ldquo;I did not come to
make a play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what, then?&rdquo; asked Flood, smiling curiously.
&ldquo;Merely to make a social call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that, either,&rdquo; returned Nick. &ldquo;I want a
few words with you, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me, eh? Well, Badger, here I am; so you may
out with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all the same to you, Mose, I&rsquo;d prefer to see
you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood began to suspect that his caller wished to borrow
some money, an experience to which he was by no
means a stranger, and a look of less concern rose to his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come to my private room, Badger,&rdquo; said he,
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
leading the way, and closing the door after they had
entered. &ldquo;Sit down if you like. Now, what can I do
for you? Are you strapped, or running low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the same room in which Flood had paid Kendall
his ninety thousand dollars, and, incidentally, included
the deck of strippers with which he had dealt himself
a loser.</p>
<p>Nick glanced about the finely furnished room, then
took a chair near the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mose, I am not here to ask a loan of you,&rdquo; said
he, smiling. &ldquo;I suppose I could have it, however, if I
wished one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it likely, Joe,&rdquo; said Flood, sitting carelessly
on a corner of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like you, Mose,&rdquo; remarked Nick, ready to note
any change in the face of his hearer. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not
here for that. I call with another object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just come down from Fordham. I live out
that way, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood started slightly and his dark brows drooped
ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Fordham?&rdquo; said he, with eyes searching Nick&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; nodded Nick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not heard the news,
I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Yet Nick was already convinced that he was right in
his suspicions, and that Flood already knew of the murder.
To learn what attitude he next would take was
Nick&rsquo;s immediate motive, on which his own course necessarily
would depend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what news do you refer, Joe?&rdquo; Flood coolly inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that chap who made a big winning here
last night. I was present at the time, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember. But what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; said Nick tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; echoed Flood, with well-feigned amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered,&rdquo; added Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered! Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though he now saw that Flood had already resolved
upon some fixed line of conduct, Nick was determined
to drive him to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was killed about nine o&rsquo;clock last night, Mose,
near the house of Doctor Royal, the Fordham rector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You amaze me! Cecil Kendall dead! Are you sure
of this, Badger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; nodded Nick. &ldquo;I saw the body myself. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
was found near the library windows, stiff as a poker,
with his head crushed in with a club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful! Horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So &rsquo;tis, Mose, but there&rsquo;s no doubt about it,&rdquo; continued
Nick, watching him as a cat watches a mouse.
&ldquo;They are dead sure it is a case of murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean by they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detective Gerry and the police. They are out there
looking for evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gerry, of the central office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God above!&rdquo; exclaimed Flood, playing his part to
perfection. &ldquo;I can hardly believe this, Badger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s true, all right,&rdquo; declared Nick. &ldquo;The
poor devil&rsquo;s winnings didn&rsquo;t do him much good, Mose.
I reckon robbery was the motive, for the satchel is missing
which you loaned him to take away the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I loaned him the satchel for that
purpose?&rdquo; Flood now demanded, with a harsh ring creeping
into his heavy voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I merely guessed at that, Mose; and it looks likely
enough. You heard young Royal&rsquo;s threats, too. Mebbe
he was the chap who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood sprang down with an oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life, Badger!&rdquo; he cried vehemently.
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
&ldquo;Royal&rsquo;s threats were the ravings of a drunken boy.
He cannot have done it. It isn&rsquo;t in him to have done it.
For your life, Badger, if you&rsquo;re a friend of mine, don&rsquo;t
ever hint again that Harry Royal committed this crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious gleam showed for an instant in Nick&rsquo;s keen
eyes, but he gave no expression to the thoughts that occasioned
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no better friend than I am, Mose, you can
gamble on that,&rdquo; he declared significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only because I wish to do you a good turn that
I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do me a good turn!&rdquo; echoed Flood, with eyes now
glowing suspiciously. &ldquo;What do you mean by that, Joe
Badger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess what I mean, Mose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Flood, with rising resentment.
&ldquo;Speak plainly. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick now drew forward in his chair and replied with
lowered voice and more impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean, Mose,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was
on the spot when this trick was turned and I heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
all that was said. Gerry has found the weapon with
which Kendall was killed. There&rsquo;s no doubt about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; demanded Flood, in perplexity too
genuine to be doubted. &ldquo;Suppose they have found it?
What&rsquo;s that to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weapon, Mose, was a heavy ironwood cane, the
same which you carried when you left this house at eight
o&rsquo;clock last evening. The murder was committed one
hour later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the rigid control he was imposing upon himself,
which was plainly obvious to Nick&rsquo;s keen discernment,
Flood now started slightly upon hearing the detective&rsquo;s
disclosures. Nick saw at once that he had
brought the gamester at least one item of news, and that
Flood, whatever he knew of the crime, was ignorant
of the means employed.</p>
<p>In an instant, however, though his face grew even more
pale, Flood again had his feelings under rigid control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of what you are saying, Badger?&rdquo; he
slowly demanded, with voice grown strangely hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead sure of it, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Kendall was killed with the cane you describe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;The evidence is conclusive. It is an ironwood cane
with a large silver head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was found hidden under some brushwood near the
rear wall of the grounds,&rdquo; continued Nick. &ldquo;It was
covered with blood; and bits of scalp and hair, plainly
those of the murdered man, had cleaved to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood heard him without moving from his seat on
the edge of the table, and with never a change in his set,
white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is strange, Badger, on my word,&rdquo; he said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another bad feature, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still another, eh? And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cane was identified by Doctor Royal as belonging
to you,&rdquo; said Nick pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He declared that he had seen you carrying it many
times, and that gave Gerry the clue for which he was
seeking. He said that you must be landed without delay.
He may arrive here at any moment to arrest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Flood neither moved nor changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him come,&rdquo; said he, with icy indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stand for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not attempt to escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I prefer to face the music. Don&rsquo;t ask me
why. That&rsquo;s my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick began to see his way more clearly. Had Flood
imagined for a moment that his visitor was Nick Carter,
he would have appreciated the difficulty of hiding his
true feelings and designs, and quite possibly have proceeded
differently. As it was, Nick was steadily getting
at the truth; yet he still had much to learn, and he saw
that Flood had resolved upon some fixed design which
he by no means would voluntarily disclose.</p>
<p>Nick was equally determined to discover of what the
design consisted, as well as the motive for it, and he now
pressed home the weapon he knew would wound deepest,
and possibly evoke a self-betrayal. With a grave shake
of his head, he slowly answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Mose, it is your business. But I told you just
now I was as good a friend as you have, and when Gerry
spoke of arresting you I hastened here to head him off
and warn you of your danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood relaxed a little, as if he appreciated the service
mentioned, and gravely answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very good of you, Badger, and you meant
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
well. But I am not a man to run when danger threatens.
I&rsquo;ve been up against it too many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let them arrest you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall make no move to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s grave voice took on a subtle ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Mose, I think you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I will!&rdquo; exclaimed Flood, with a dark
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it does not suit me, Mose, that you shall be
arrested for Kendall&rsquo;s murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not suit you! Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a very good reason. If robbery was the motive
for the crime, I happen to know that you did not commit
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Flood hoarsely gasped. &ldquo;How
do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because no man would kill another for money voluntarily
lost to him within an hour,&rdquo; cried Nick sharply.
&ldquo;I was wise to your play last night. I saw you deal a
very clever brace game, and yet you made yourself a
loser. With a deck of strippers you forced Kendall to
win the money for which he afterward was slain&mdash;but
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
not by you, Moses Flood! I&rsquo;ll stake my life upon that,
let the evidence be what it may. You&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your life! God above, Badger, if you value that life,
listen to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s rapid verbal thrusts had accomplished just
what he had expected.</p>
<p>Yet the change that had come over the gambler was
one to have startled and alarmed most men. As he
heard the words that told him his secret was known to
another, Flood became ghastly white, sat silent for a moment,
then suddenly sprang down from the table, gave
utterance to the interruption noted, and seized Nick by
the throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mad&mdash;mad!&rdquo; he fiercely continued, with eyes
blazing and his voice choked with rage. &ldquo;I did nothing
of the kind. My loss was on the level. If you ever
breathe another word of this, Joe Badger, I&rsquo;ll throttle
your life from your body. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go, Mose, or you&rsquo;ll have done it here and now!&rdquo;
cried Nick, struggling to his feet and throwing off the
impassioned man. &ldquo;I know what I saw last night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie! You lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m out to learn the truth, Mose, the whole
truth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Hark you!&rdquo; interrupted Flood, livid with
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
passion. &ldquo;I say you are wrong&mdash;wrong&mdash;wrong! If
you ever again assert that I dealt a false card last night,
so help me Heaven, I will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>Again the street door-bell rang loudly through the
house.</p>
<p>Flood instantly dropped his hand from Nick&rsquo;s collar,
abruptly terminated the threat he was about to utter, then
turned like one electrified and sprang to open the door
of the outer room.</p>
<p>The humpback, with eyes starting from his head, appeared
on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God in Heaven!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, with his uncouth
face convulsed with alarm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Detective Gerry, of
the central office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick saw and heard, and his bearded features took on
a look of sudden passionate resolution. With a bound
he reached the gambler&rsquo;s side and threw him back toward
the table, at the same time crying, with terrible sternness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark you, Flood! Not a word! You must escape!
Your arrest must be prevented! Leave this detective to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter&rsquo;s influence at such a critical moment was
irresistible. Moses Flood, scarce knowing why, recoiled
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
from the terrible look on the detective&rsquo;s face, and Nick
instantly strode into the outer room, closing the door
behind him.</p>
<p>The humpback was already darting to secure the heavy
door leading into the hall, with a view to preventing
Gerry&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p>Before this could be accomplished, however, the central
office man, who had bounded up the stairs, and saw
the swinging door, hurled himself forcibly against it and
came nearly headlong into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Gerry!&rdquo; cried Nick coolly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerry glared at him, as he recovered his equilibrium,
but failed to recognize him. Whipping out a document
from his pocket, he cried sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that I have a warrant here for the arrest of
Moses Flood. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest of Flood, eh?&rdquo; rejoined Nick, with a derisive
laugh. &ldquo;Why the devil didn&rsquo;t you come in on horseback
to serve it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerry, who was an impulsive fellow, though a very
capable officer, resented the remark with an ugly snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your durned business!&rdquo; he cried angrily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have come in an automobile if I&rsquo;d wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;You might have come in a balloon, Gerry, for all I
should have cared,&rdquo; retorted Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flood&rsquo;s not here, as you may see for yourself. It&rsquo;s
a bit early for him to show up. Come down at this hour
of the night, Gerry, and you&rsquo;ll find him. There are but
few of us owls out in the sunlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently you&rsquo;re looking for trouble, mister,&rdquo; snapped
Gerry, with a threatening nod at Nick. &ldquo;I happen to
know that Flood is here, for Peters said so at the street
door. He&rsquo;s not so far away but that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; thundered Gerry, drawing a revolver. &ldquo;If
you interfere with me, my man. I&rsquo;ll let daylight into
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before Nick could prevent him the central office
man sprang aside, bounded to the door of Flood&rsquo;s private
room, and violently threw it open.</p>
<p>One glance into the room was sufficient.</p>
<p>Even Nick Carter was startled and momentarily
amazed.</p>
<p>For the private room, despite that the windows were
thirty feet above the ground, and only one door visible,
was found to be vacant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Moses Flood had vanished as mysteriously as if the
walls of the room, or the floor itself, had opened and
swallowed him.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />NEW CLUES.</h2>
<p>As Gerry drew back, amazed at not finding Flood in
his private room, Nick caught one swift, significant
glance from John Green, the humpback, whose face had
lighted like that of nature after a summer shower.</p>
<p>The glance spoke even louder than words, and it told
Nick what he already had begun to suspect&mdash;that a secret
door existed, concealed in one of the walls of the room,
by which Flood had easily made his escape.</p>
<p>That he had decided to do so, moreover, suited Nick to
the very letter; and, with a cautionary wink at the humpback,
he observed derisively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re down on a dead card, Gerry, that&rsquo;s plain
enough. I told you that Flood was not here, and as you
now may see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Peters informed me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Peters told you is of no consequence,&rdquo; interrupted
Nick. &ldquo;It is half-an-hour since Peters admitted
him, and Flood has gone out meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Much to his own satisfaction, Nick now felt tolerably
sure that he spoke the truth, and that Flood had for
some reason changed his mind and resolved to evade
arrest. With a keen insight that was eminently characteristic
of him, moreover, when measuring men&rsquo;s motives
from their conduct, Nick already suspected the occasion
of the gambler&rsquo;s change of mind.</p>
<p>Nick did not defer his departure, therefore, merely to
have further words with Gerry. Leaving the latter to
take what action he pleased, he bestowed upon the humpback
a wink that plainly advised a discreet silence, then
coolly marched down the stairs and out of the house.</p>
<p>He had accomplished more than superficially appears,
as will soon become obvious, and had paved the way
for another curiously artful move.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when he left the gaming-house,
and having removed his disguise at an opportune moment
Nick next headed for the Milmore Trust Company,
to have a word with President Gilsey.</p>
<p>Just as he was approaching the bank building, however,
he saw a flashily clad young lady emerge, none
other than Gilsey&rsquo;s stenographer, then about going to
her lunch.</p>
<p>The instant Nick saw her he was struck with an idea,
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
and, as previously remarked of Nick, to think was to act.
He quickly intercepted the girl, to whom he said a bit
curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Miss Belle Braddon, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle arched her brows, stared at him for a moment,
then pursed her red lips, and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my name. But, really, I don&rsquo;t recall you,
neither your face nor your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; said Nick, with a rather impressive
nod. &ldquo;You just think a bit, and you&rsquo;ll presently speak
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, is that so?&rdquo; queried the girl, in tones of insolence.
&ldquo;Ah, now that I look again, I believe I do. You
are Detective Carter, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you in Mr. Gilsey&rsquo;s office yesterday, did I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right again, Miss Braddon. And there&rsquo;s a question
I wish you to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you tell Moses Flood that Kendall was short
in his accounts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick asked the question in a way that sent the color
from the girl&rsquo;s cheeks, and her eyes betrayed that he
had hit the nail on the head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Yet Miss Braddon flushed hotly after a moment and
curtly said, with a resentful frown:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not! Why do you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know that Flood learned of it, and you&rsquo;re
the only person, except Mr. Gilsey, who could have
told him. Now, why did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle Braddon shrugged her shoulders, hesitated for a
moment, and then indulged in a low, mocking laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your assertion is really too absurd, Detective Carter,&rdquo;
she glibly replied. &ldquo;To begin with, I did not know
that Kendall was short in his accounts; and to end with,
I have not seen Moses Flood for a week. You think
I&rsquo;m lying, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see that you do, so don&rsquo;t deny it. Come round
and call on me some evening, Detective Carter, and we&rsquo;ll
talk it over&mdash;or have a game of ping-pong, if you prefer.
I mustn&rsquo;t be seen talking too long with a man on the
street. It&rsquo;s not good form, you know; so I&rsquo;ll bid you
good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which Miss Braddon gathered up her skirts, gave
Nick a nod and smile of the chip-on-my-shoulder type,
then tripped away without a look behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Nick knew that she had lied, but it served his purpose
to let her go. Yet he grimly said to himself as he entered
the Trust Building:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure that it&rsquo;s not au revoir, young lady,
instead of good-by. I now suspect you of cutting in this
affair a figure bigger than a cipher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick found Mr. Gilsey in his private office, dismayed
by the news he had received, not only of Cecil Kendall&rsquo;s
murder, but also of the latter&rsquo;s recent career, plainly
indicating that the deficit at the bank was a deplorable
probability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now have experts at work on the books, Detective
Carter, and we shall soon know the worst,&rdquo; said he, after
their greeting and a brief discussion of the crime discovered
that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am like a man in a nightmare,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I can
scarcely realize what has occurred, and hardly know
where I stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not to be wondered at,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;The situation
is serious enough surely, but I shall continue my
work on the case and do the best I can with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have said that Kendall won a large sum of
money last night, of which he was robbed. Do you think
there is any possibility of recovering that money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall try to do so, Mr. Gilsey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you may succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall make every effort, sir. There are several
questions I wish you to answer, and I must then hasten
away upon other work bearing on the case. To begin
with, Gilsey, has Kendall been observably friendly with
your private stenographer, Miss Braddon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilsey looked surprised for a moment, then answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I think that he has been. They have frequently
lunched in company, and I have heard of them
at the theaters together. I cannot, of course, say to what
extent their intimacy has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not matter particularly,&rdquo; replied Nick. &ldquo;You
stated yesterday that she lives with her uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is one of our depositors. His name is Godard&mdash;Nathan
Godard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! Flood&rsquo;s lookout at the faro-bank!&rdquo; Nick
exclaimed to himself. &ldquo;By Jove! this affair is shaping
itself up in a new light. I begin to scent a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no betrayal of his momentary surprise, however,
Nick presently said aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How large a deposit does Godard carry here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several thousand dollars at times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Flood&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; thought Nick promptly. &ldquo;Deposited
in Godard&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is comparatively small now, however, amounting
to only a few hundred dollars,&rdquo; added Gilsey. &ldquo;Surely,
Carter, you do not suspect my stenographer or her uncle
of having any part in these crimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick did not tell him what he suspected. Instead, he
said gravely, as he took his hat to depart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not prepared to make any statement, Mr. Gilsey.
I have, however, a bit of advice to give you, which I
wish you to promptly follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is your advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get rid of your stenographer with the least possible
delay, Mr. Gilsey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she returns from lunch, sir, discharge her immediately,
and without a recommendation,&rdquo; added Nick.
&ldquo;If she asks you why you do so, inform her that Nick
Carter advises it! Nay, even more than that, tell her that
I command it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no buts, Gilsey,&rdquo; protested Nick emphatically.
&ldquo;Either do this, and do it this very day, or up go
my hands and I drop the whole case. I do not give such
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
instructions as these without an object. When the time
comes, Gilsey, you shall know why I insist upon this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gilsey did not fancy the expression on Nick&rsquo;s face, and
he wisely pulled in his horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly, Carter, if you put it in that way,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;I will discharge Miss Braddon the moment she
returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I fail to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see at the proper time, Gilsey, take my word
for that,&rdquo; interrupted Nick. &ldquo;Now, there is one more
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write Nathan Godard at once, and instruct him to
withdraw his deposit. Give him no reason, mind you,
but insist upon his closing his account here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, this is a curious proceeding&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not think so, Gilsey,&rdquo; Nick again interrupted
significantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll comply without an objection, take
my word for that. Look to it, Gilsey, and leave all the
rest to me. I&rsquo;ll turn a trick for you of some importance,
old chap, before this case ends. But no more on that
subject just now. I must be off at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the banker to stare and wonder, Nick hastened
from the building and headed for home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nathan Godard, eh?&rdquo; he grimly soliloquized, as he
walked briskly away. &ldquo;Uncle to Belle Braddon, eh?
And she has been hand and glove with Kendall, eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s as simple as two times two. The girl is
queer from her feet up, a clever crook, secretly a capper
for the game at Moses Flood&rsquo;s. As likely as not, Mose
does not know of it, but I&rsquo;d go my pile that Godard has
been using the girl for a decoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred to one that she started Kendall on the
down grade and lured him into Godard&rsquo;s clutches. When
a girl of her stamp works at a respectable vocation, it is
invariably with an evil design. From the day she
sought employment in that bank, the jade had Kendall
marked for her secret prey; and Godard opened an
account there only to give things a better look to the
poor devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, he has danced his dance and has now
paid the price. His blood is on some man&rsquo;s hands, and
I must learn whose. Luckily, I now know some hands
that are still clean, despite the mass of evidence to the
contrary. Unless I am greatly mistaken, I shall give that
central office sleuth, Gerry, a queer feeling before this
case goes upon record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus musing, Nick hastened home, where he found
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
Chick just returned from the Carleton Chambers and a
call upon young Harry Royal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did he have to say for himself?&rdquo; asked
Nick, the moment he entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spoke fairly enough,&rdquo; replied Chick, laying aside
his cigar. &ldquo;He says he did not go to Fordham last evening,
but went directly from the faro-bank to his room
in the Carleton Chambers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a liar!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve struck a clue, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thread, Chick&mdash;merely a thread. Yet I&rsquo;ll wager I
know to what it leads. I&rsquo;ll not delay to explain, for
I want a crack at that young man myself. Did you leave
him at his lodgings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, less than half-an-hour ago,&rdquo; nodded Chick. &ldquo;I
think you&rsquo;ll find him there, for he appeared badly knocked
out, and said he was as sick as a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result of a week&rsquo;s debauch,&rdquo; growled Nick censoriously.
&ldquo;It serves him right. Did you inform him of
Kendall&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had already heard of it, Nick, and that Flood is
suspected of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! So the news has spread, eh? Well, I&rsquo;ll soon
settle that chap&rsquo;s breakfast. I want a bout with him
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
before others can get in a blow. Just wait a bit, Chick;
I want your opinion of a disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick hurried from the room and Chick resumed his
cigar. At the end of ten minutes the former returned,
yet one would never have known him.</p>
<p>His figure was slightly padded, his brows darkened,
his lower features heavily bearded, and he was tastefully
clad in a suit of black, with a generous display of immaculate
shirt-front and a piercing solitaire stud.</p>
<p>Barring the heavy beard, Nick at that moment was a
counterfeit presentment of&mdash;Moses Flood.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />DRIVEN TO THE WALL.</h2>
<p>To strike while the iron is hot, to seize upon every
clue while it was fresh, to be alert for the least sign, the
slightest word, the fleetest glance, that might even remotely
suggest the key to a mystery, and then to quickly
follow every thread, however finely spun, and discover
whither it led&mdash;all this was characteristic of Nick Carter,
and to it he owed much of his success.</p>
<p>Few detectives, however, though of the shrewdest,
would have discerned the spider-web clues which Nick
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
had that morning detected, or have been able to turn them
to the best advantage.</p>
<p>It required a man of Nick Carter&rsquo;s superior art to
execute the delicate and superlatively crafty move that
took him to the Carleton Chambers.</p>
<p>The room occupied by Harry Royal was on the third
floor front, and the occupant was alone when Nick, disguised
as described, rapped sharply on the door.</p>
<p>For fully a minute there was no response from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear!&rdquo; said Nick to himself. &ldquo;The terror born of
conscious guilt is upon him. He dreads every sound,
fears every visitor, yet dares not leave his chamber.
Solitude and secret dread are preferable to the voice and
eyes of an accuser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick rapped again, louder.</p>
<p>Then a step within echoed the sound, and the door was
finally opened.</p>
<p>Harry Royal, sober enough now, and as white and
haggard as if from a long illness, appeared on the
threshold, his boyish figure clad in a long, loose house
robe.</p>
<p>Nick fell as cleverly as an actor into the part he designed
to play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he instantly whispered, with startling intensity.
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
&ldquo;I see that you&rsquo;re alone! Not a word till I am
under cover! Let me come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First let me come in,&rdquo; persisted Nick, fairly forcing
his way into the room. &ldquo;I may be seen here, recognized,
arrested on the spot. It&rsquo;s for your sake I am here, Harry
Royal, as well as my own. Now close the door and lock
it. I am taking long chances for these few words with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terrible fear of arrest expressed and displayed by
Nick, even more than his feigned voice of the gamester
and the latter&rsquo;s almost habitual attire, suddenly suggested
to Royal the possible identity of his disguised visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed under his breath. &ldquo;Is
it you, Mose Flood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d not ask that question were I to doff this disguise,&rdquo;
replied Nick, with bitter asperity. &ldquo;Have you
locked the door? Don&rsquo;t open it, then, for man or devil,
without first giving me time to hide. I am wanted for
murder! Do you hear? I am wanted for murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a mighty effort Royal had pulled himself together,
yet his hueless cheeks and dilated eyes, burning as
if with fever, betrayed his consternation and dismay. He
tottered to a chair near the table and sank into it as if
his limbs refused longer to support him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good God, Mose, what brings you here?&rdquo; he hoarsely
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon tell you, have no doubt of that,&rdquo; rejoined
Nick, with threatening significance.</p>
<p>While he spoke he drew a chair to the opposite side of
the table, so placing it that the light from the window
should not fall upon his face and possibly reveal his
deception.</p>
<p>Then he sat down, fixed his frowning eyes upon the
face of the cringing young man opposite, and said
sternly, still cleverly imitating Flood&rsquo;s resonant voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you done with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Royal caught his breath, gripped hard at the arms of
his chair for a moment, then answered, in tones of intense
amazement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done with what, Mose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine question!&rdquo; sneered Nick, with a terrible display
of suppressed passion. &ldquo;What money, indeed! The
money of which you robbed Cecil Kendall, after beating
out his brains under the windows of your own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Royal was as white as a corpse, yet by a mighty effort
of will he governed his agitation, and found voice with
which to reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are mad, Mose&mdash;stark mad!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.
&ldquo;I did nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; hissed Nick ferociously. &ldquo;I saw you out
there. I saw you do it&mdash;or just after you had done it.
Don&rsquo;t lie to me, Royal. You may blind others with a
lie, perhaps, but you can&rsquo;t blind me. I say I saw you
do it, or at least saw you just after you did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of utter despair had settled on Royal&rsquo;s bloodless
face, and he was trembling from head to foot. Yet in
his staring eyes there was a look of misery and mute
appeal that words could not describe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my word you are wrong, Mose, utterly wrong!&rdquo;
he cried piteously. &ldquo;I did not do it. I have not got
the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have! I say I saw you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not see me do it. You did not see me kill
him, for I did not do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you out there,&rdquo; reiterated Nick, with augmented
vehemence. &ldquo;If you deny the truth to me, that I saw
you out there last night, I&rsquo;ll throttle you where you sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Royal breathed hard and heavy, as if he already felt a
hand at his throat. His staring eyes appeared held by
Nick&rsquo;s intense gaze, and the latter&rsquo;s stern and threatening
face awed and terrified him. For thirty seconds he hesitated,
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
then faltered brokenly, like a man whose abject
fear drove him to admit the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;God help me, Mose, what shall I do? I&mdash;I
confess that I was out there, Mose; but, on my oath, I did
not kill Kendall. I swear to Heaven, Mose, I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick felt a thrill of satisfaction. He had scored one
important point and verified one of his suspicions&mdash;that
Royal had gone to Fordham after leaving the faro-bank,
despite having denied it to Chick.</p>
<p>Nick now let up a little on his terror-filled victim. Yet,
without betraying his secret satisfaction, he sternly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you did not kill him, but I have only your
word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My oath, Mose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! Silence, and hear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am listening, Mose. For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t be so
harsh. I have trouble enough, Heaven knows. I am a
wreck of myself and know not where to turn. I am
listening, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick rather pitied the misguided fellow, yet his pity did
not deter him from playing his shrewd game to a finish.
He leaned nearer over the table, saying with unabated
severity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark you, then! You&rsquo;ve not forgotten your threats
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
made in my place last night. I heard them, and knew of
what a drunken fool is capable. So I hastened out to
Fordham to head you off from any crime. God forgive
me, I arrived too late. I arrived only to see you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not see me do it, Mose, so help me Heaven!&rdquo;
Royal hoarsely interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw enough,&rdquo; cried Nick, with terrible significance.
&ldquo;Miserable young man that you are, you have left me but
one course. Don&rsquo;t you see what I am doing? Don&rsquo;t you
see where I stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you stand?&rdquo; echoed Royal, white and staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no brains?&rdquo; continued Nick, with augmented
feeling. &ldquo;You know that I revere your father,
that I love your sister. Don&rsquo;t you see, misguided boy,
that, for their sake, to spare them the awful shame and
sorrow of beholding you a criminal, I have taken your
guilt on my own shoulders? Don&rsquo;t you see it, blind
man, that for the sake of their peace and happiness, not
for yours, I am inviting suspicion and taking even the
hazard of the electric chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Carter, incomparably shrewd in his discernment
and deductions, was indeed impersonating Moses Flood
to the very letter. That the motives just expressed were
the real motives actuating Moses Flood in his recent conduct,
Nick had not a doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>For a moment Royal stared at him like one who could
not speak. Then the meaning of what he had heard, and
the overwhelming self-sacrifice so vividly pictured,
seemed to dawn upon him with full force. It did even
more, just as Nick had expected. It brought to the lips
of the unhappy young man the words of gratitude and
the much more important disclosure of the whole truth,
which Nick Carter from the first had but aimed to evoke.</p>
<p>With countenance changing, with eyes lighting perceptibly,
Royal presently said, more calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I believe my ears? Do you mean, Moses Flood,
that you had no hand in that crime, and that your present
conduct is inspired by the sentiments you have
expressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never speak idly, boy,&rdquo; cried Nick impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, God hearing me, my father and sister owe you
a debt of gratitude that words cannot repay,&rdquo; declared
Royal fervently. &ldquo;I will not speak of my own feelings,
save to repeat that you are wrong, absolutely wrong; for
I am ignorant as you concerning who killed Cecil Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick believed him, yet he grimly shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still doubt me,&rdquo; cried Royal quickly, now eager
to explain and set himself right. &ldquo;Wait a moment, Mose.
I don&rsquo;t deny that you have grounds for suspicion, after
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
the threats I made and what you may have seen at the
rectory. But let me explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My threats were but foolish ravings, Mose, on my
word, I had no intention of executing them, but I determined
to have what I thought was my part of Kendall&rsquo;s
winnings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After leaving your place, Mose, I did go to Fordham,&rdquo;
said Royal, with nervous haste. &ldquo;I knew that
Kendall had an appointment with my sister, and I
expected to find him at the rectory. The journey out
there in the fresh night air, however, served to cool my
blood and bring me to my senses. On entering the
rectory grounds I realized that I was in no condition to
meet my father, from whom I have concealed the wild
and foolish habits into which I have lately fallen. As
true as Heaven, Mose, I am done with them from this
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do out there?&rdquo; demanded Nick, with
feigned incredulity. &ldquo;Come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of entering the house,&rdquo; Royal hastened to
reply, with increased earnestness, &ldquo;I went to look through
the library windows, to see if Kendall was in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; echoed Royal, with a gasp and shudder, &ldquo;then
I stumbled on Kendall&rsquo;s dead body, not ten feet away
from the library window. My God, Mose, you cannot
imagine my horror and my dreadful alarm. The desperate
threats I had made in your place suddenly recurred
to me. I saw myself under arrest for the crime. I was
like a man in a hideous nightmare, and I did only what
men do in such a frenzy of terror and dismay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fled like a madman from the spot and returned to
the city. Avoiding observation, Mose, and stealing into
this house by one of the side doors, I came here to my
room. I have not since been out of it. I have not dared
to go out. I have been waiting here, in abject fear and
trembling, for the worst that may come. I know I am
a coward Mose&mdash;a cur and a coward; but, so help me
God, I have told you the whole truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Royal,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;But you have
overlooked one very important fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Royal started at the change of tone, and again grew
deathly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fact, Mose?&rdquo; he faintly gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have confessed yourself, not to Moses Flood, but
to Nick Carter, the detective.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>And Nick grimly removed his heavy beard while he
spoke, and rose abruptly to his feet.</p>
<p>For the bare fraction of a second Harry Royal hung
fire under his sudden stress of alarm and excitement.
He sat like a man momentarily dazed, with his hueless
features drawn and twitching convulsively, and his wild
eyes half starting from his head.</p>
<p>Then with a half-smothered scream of dismay he
ripped open the table drawer at which he sat and
snatched out a revolver.</p>
<p>Before Nick fairly realized it, so rapid and quick was
the move, he found himself with the weapon leveled
pointblank at his head.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />NICK CALLS THE TURN.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You throw up your hands, Carter, and listen to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the command that came from Harry Royal as
he leveled his revolver at the detective&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Nick promptly obeyed.</p>
<p>The shrewd detective, however, was laughing in his
sleeve. He had learned from long experience that there
is little to be feared from a man who pulls a gun and does
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
not instantly fire. In nine cases out of ten the act is only
a bluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be arrested, Carter, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind
to that,&rdquo; Royal hoarsely cried. &ldquo;Death is preferable to
the disgrace and horror of a prison cell. I don&rsquo;t intend
to harm you, but I swear I&rsquo;ll shoot myself if you attempt
to arrest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick was smiling now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You evidently take me for a foe, Royal,&rdquo; said he
genially. &ldquo;Instead, my boy, I am as good a friend as you
have in the world. Put up that toy, Royal, and prepare
to go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not to the Tombs,&rdquo; interrupted Nick heartily.
&ldquo;I know that you are innocent of any crime, and I am
here only to serve you to the best advantage, as well as
others who are dear to you. I want you to go to my
residence with me, and for the present remain concealed
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo; demanded Royal, struck with surprise
and gradually dropping his weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I cannot delay to explain,&rdquo; laughed Nick, in
friendly fashion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do so later, however. What I
most fear, just now, Royal, is that Detective Gerry, of
the central office, may show up here at any moment.
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
Take my word for it, my boy, he&rsquo;ll land you in the Tombs
in short order, and that&rsquo;s what I wish to prevent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean this, Carter, that you are really my
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try me and see,&rdquo; laughed Nick. &ldquo;They who know
me well will tell you that I never lie like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Royal sprang to his feet and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo; he impulsively cried, with
his boyish countenance fairly transfigured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you,&rdquo; nodded Nick, shaking him warmly by
the hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never regret it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go with you when and where you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I&rsquo;m infernally mystified&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll explain all a little later, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll dust from here at once, sir, for Gerry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Not too fast. I wish it to
appear that you have fled, as you very likely would have
done if you were guilty of Kendall&rsquo;s murder. No, no,
don&rsquo;t stop to question me. I&rsquo;ll make it clear enough to
you by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; cried Royal, now glad enough to comply.
&ldquo;You just tell me what to do, Detective Carter, and
I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First put things in shape here, as if you had hurriedly
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
departed,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;It will be very easy for Gerry
and the police to assume that you had some hand in the
crime, and that you have now jumped the country. I&rsquo;ll
loan you this disguise, that you may not be recognized as
we go out, and then we&rsquo;ll make a bee-line for my residence.
Once there, my boy, we may discuss the situation
without fear of intruders. Come, come, look lively. The
sooner we are away, lad, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much time was required for preparing the indications
of hurried flight which Nick wished the room to
present, and at the end of a quarter of an hour the two
men left the Carleton Chambers building, Royal in the
disguise with which Nick had provided him, and together
they at once proceeded to the detective&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>Upon entering his office with Royal, Nick met with a
slight surprise, not entirely unexpected, yet not anticipated
quite so soon.</p>
<p>With a significant wink, Chick received him with the
remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man in the library, Nick, waiting to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick took the cue given him, saying inquiringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>With a smile of genuine satisfaction, Nick turned to
Royal and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off that disguise, my boy, and conceal yourself
back of yonder door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what, sir?&rdquo; asked Royal, perplexed and surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect something to be said here that I wish you to
overhear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, mind you, nor a move of any kind, until
I give you permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, sir, I&rsquo;ll be silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conceal yourself at once, then,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Now,
Chick, bring in the caller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick departed to the library, returning at the end of
a minute.</p>
<p>He was accompanied by&mdash;Moses Flood.</p>
<p>Nick had discarded his black coat, having put on an
office jacket, and he was found seated at his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Moses, how are you?&rdquo; said he, looking up with
an innocent smile when the noted gambler entered.</p>
<p>Flood was as carefully dressed as usual, and appeared
remarkably dignified and composed. Yet his face was
very pale and his mouth noticeably firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly well, Nick,&rdquo; he gravely replied, accepting the
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
chair to which Nick graciously waved him. &ldquo;I am glad
you have returned. I have been waiting to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting long, Mose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten minutes. No, don&rsquo;t go, Chick. My business
is not private. I prefer, in fact, that you also should hear
what I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mose,&rdquo; laughed Chick, taking a chair.
&ldquo;Just as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, Flood?&rdquo; inquired Nick.</p>
<p>The gambler cleared his throat before he replied, then
said, with grave feeling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin with, Nick, despite that our vocations in life
have been decidedly opposed, and mine not one to be
proud of, we have never had any conflict that I can recall,
and I feel rather justified in saying that we are fairly
good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Nick simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish to state, Nick, that I have played my last
card. Whatever the morrow has in store for me, whether
good or ill, fortune or misfortune, I never again will
gamble in any way as long as I live. I am done with it
forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick promptly extended his hand and took that of the
speaker, giving it a grip that made Flood wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a thousand times more than glad to hear you say
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
this, Mose,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;and I know that your word, when
you give it thus, is as good as any government bond.
I&rsquo;m rejoiced to be the first to take your hand upon it;
and, as far as friendship goes, Mose, you have no better
friend in the world than Nick Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s outward composure, which was absolutely marvelous
at times, remained as marked as when he sat dealing
cards which made him nearly a hundred thousand
dollars loser, for the sake of a girl&rsquo;s happiness whose
hand had been denied him, and to whose love he believed
he had no earthly hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Nick,&rdquo; said he gravely. &ldquo;And I thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a man as you, Mose, can make his mark in any
path in life, and a brilliant mark, too,&rdquo; added Nick. &ldquo;I
see a grand future for you now, and I say heartily, God
speed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood shrugged his broad shoulders and smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of the future, Nick,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;At
all events, however, free me from one thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Namely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am led to this renunciation of my business by
any fear or thought of the future,&rdquo; said Flood, with profound
feeling. &ldquo;Now, Nick, having declared my better
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
resolutions, I will come to the chief point and tell you
why I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume you have heard the news, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refer to that murder out in Fordham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mose, I have heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Nick, I have come here to give myself into
custody,&rdquo; said Flood, with unaltered quietude. &ldquo;You
being a good friend, and a man I have always admired, I
preferred to have you take me in rather than one of those
infernally meddlesome sleuths of the central office. Nick,
I yield myself your prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To say that Chick Carter was startled and surprised is
putting it tamely.</p>
<p>Nick, however, was not in the least surprised. He had,
with extraordinary shrewdness, and for reasons presently
to appear, expected nothing less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My prisoner, eh?&rdquo; said he, smiling, with a curious
twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;For what, Mose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the murder of Cecil Kendall,&rdquo; said Flood quietly.
&ldquo;I confess to having committed the crime, Nick, and you
may run me in as soon as you please. The sooner the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick sat back in his chair, elevated his heels to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
edge of his desk, then said complacently, still oddly
smiling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you, Flood, but I really cannot
accept your magnanimous offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not accept it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Mose,&rdquo; laughed Nick, &ldquo;my reputation as a
detective is involved. When I run a man in for committing
a crime I always make it a point to run in&mdash;the
right man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood half started from his chair, then controlled himself
with a violent mental effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Nick?&rdquo; he demanded,
frowning darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say, Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I am not the right man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my confession&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your confession has no weight with me, Mose,&rdquo; interrupted
Nick decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No weight! Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are making it to shield another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Royal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are in love with his sister, Mose, and you
went to Fordham last evening to see her,&rdquo; cried Nick.
&ldquo;Instead, you saw Harry Royal near Kendall&rsquo;s dead body,
and you now believe that he committed the murder. So
you are taking his supposed crime upon your own
shoulders, for the sake of Medora Royal and her father,
with even greater sacrifice than when you purposely dealt
cards which made you a loser to the amount of ninety
thousand dollars, to set Kendall on his feet, merely because
you thought Dora Royal loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before this was half uttered Moses Flood was upon
his feet, as white as the collar at his pulsing throat and
with eyes burning like living fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you man or devil, Nick Carter, that you know
these things?&rdquo; he cried, with lips convulsively twitching.</p>
<p>Nick laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, Mose,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sometimes known
by the name of&mdash;Badger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood drew back with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badger&mdash;you&rsquo;re not Joe Badger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom I saw this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was at my place last night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God, I see it all now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Mose!&rdquo; cried Nick. &ldquo;Not too fast. Not
quite all. You fail to see what you yourself have once
declared&mdash;that it was not in young Royal to have killed
his friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood caught his breath as he comprehended the significance
of the last remark, and he sprang toward Nick
like a man electrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean, Nick, that he is
guiltless?&rdquo; he cried, as if in a frenzy of suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you prove it? Can you prove it? I&rsquo;ll give you
my fortune, Nick, if you can prove that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come forth there, from behind the door,&rdquo; shouted
Nick.</p>
<p>And Harry Royal, deeply moved by what he had heard,
with tears in his eyes and sobs shaking him, strode out
from his concealment.</p>
<p>Flood reeled a little, staring, gasping for breath, then
raised his hands and pointed to the young man he had
so unselfishly served.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw him&mdash;I saw him above the body!&rdquo; he cried
wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I discovered it only by chance, Mose, on my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the satchel&mdash;you had in your hand the satchel
with the money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, on my life, no!&rdquo; screamed Royal. &ldquo;It was
my own, the satchel I had brought from Boston. I had
it when I left your house. I know no more than you of
the killing of Cecil Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood threw back his head with a cry of relief too
great for words, and Nick Carter laughed deeply and
sprang up to grasp him by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are one man in ten million, Mose, who would
thus lay down his life for the love of another,&rdquo; he cried
warmly. &ldquo;Calm yourself, old chap. I told you I was a
friend on whom you could rely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood gazed at him with glistening eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Heaven, Nick, I owe you a debt I can never
repay,&rdquo; said he, with much emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; laughed Nick heartily. &ldquo;As you men say
who writhe under the tiger&rsquo;s claws, as you lately have
been writhing, Mose, I have merely called the turn for
you. Run you in, eh? No, no, my man, not I. When
I make a move of that kind I want the right man. To
get the bracelets on him&mdash;that&rsquo;s the work that still lies
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
before me. It may prove to be the most difficult and
dangerous of all. The relations of you two men&mdash;humph!
the adjustment of them was easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even thus indifferently could the great detective regard
the clever work by which he had verified many of his
suspicions through bringing these two men together.</p>
<p>The explanations that presently followed served to
greatly clear the situation, despite that they offered no
clue to Kendall&rsquo;s assassin.</p>
<p>Harry Royal&rsquo;s story, as previously told to Nick, was
entirely true.</p>
<p>As regarded Flood, it appeared that he had driven
to Fordham in a buggy, in the body of which he had
placed his cane. Wishing to secretly have a last interview
with Dora Royal, he had hitched his team at the
rear gate, then crossed the rectory grounds to try to see
her. As he approached the house, however, he saw
Royal by the light from the library windows, crouching
above the body of Kendall, who must have been slain
but a brief time before.</p>
<p>Before Flood could accost him, Royal leaped up and
fled at the top of his speed. After the threats the latter
had made, Flood felt sure he had committed the murder.
Overwhelmed by the discovery, he had at once driven
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
back to town and put up his team, entirely forgetting the
cane which he had when starting out.</p>
<p>During the night he resolved upon the magnanimous
course he would adopt, just as Nick had suspected. Next
morning, however, when confronted by Badger, he discovered
that the latter knew far too much and must be
silenced. Hence the interruption of Gerry during their
interview led Flood to escape by a secret door, with the
intention of afterward seeking Badger, to buy his silence.
Not knowing where to find him, however, Flood finally
decided to clinch matters by giving himself up to Nick
Carter and flatly asserting that he had committed the
crime.</p>
<p>While simple enough in a way, Nick&rsquo;s deductions from
the conflicting circumstances were exceedingly clever.
The passionate indignation of Flood, when Nick intimated
that Royal might be the guilty party, at once convinced
the detective that that was Flood&rsquo;s own opinion.
Nick instantly decided, therefore, that Flood must have
been at Fordham that night, and very likely had seen
Royal in some incriminating situation.</p>
<p>Believing that Royal would lie about the matter if questioned
by a detective, Nick decided that he could learn
the exact truth by personating Flood for that purpose.
Hence the curious and effective ruse he had adopted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Such, in brief, were the explanations which greatly
cleared matters, and the gratitude of Royal for the heroic
part assumed by Moses Flood may be easily imagined.</p>
<p>Added to this, moreover, when Nick quietly disclosed
to Flood the true sentiments of Medora Royal, and the
misleading statement made by her father, along with the
probability that the past would be forgiven and Flood&rsquo;s
suit favorably considered, the situation, at least in so far
as Flood was concerned, became changed indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Nick emphatically declared a little later, &ldquo;there
is one fact not to be ignored. The murderer of Kendall
still is at large, and he must be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; cried Chick. &ldquo;By Jove! I don&rsquo;t
see that we are any nearer that than at the outset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; admitted Nick, smiling oddly. &ldquo;But
I have an idea that we shall finally land him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any suspicion, Carter, or formed any
plans?&rdquo; inquired Flood, with countenance evincing the
happiness Nick had brought him.</p>
<p>Nick looked a bit grim and threatening when he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicions, no,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Plans, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Namely?&rdquo; inquired Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This work is for you and me alone, Chick,&rdquo; said Nick
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
decidedly. &ldquo;For the present, both Flood and Harry
Royal must remain concealed here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to have it appear that they have fled, as if both
of them were parties to the murder. This will serve us in
two ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, it will set Gerry and the police on a wild-goose
chase, and leave the way open to our work and investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Nick,&rdquo; nodded Chick. &ldquo;A good scheme,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second,&rdquo; added Nick, &ldquo;it will tend to relieve the real
criminal of immediate apprehensions, and convince him
that he is not suspected. That will make his detection all
the easier for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now draw up your chairs, all of you, and I will outline
my plans. The most important work, and undoubtedly
the most hazardous, still remains to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />TWO BAD EGGS.</h2>
<p>Nearly a month passed before the scheme devised by
Nick Carter, by which to run down Cecil Kendall&rsquo;s murderer,
was productive of any startling results.</p>
<p>Yet the month was not without incidents worthy of
note.</p>
<p>The chief mystery was the disappearance of Moses
Flood and Harry Royal. The wiseacres of the central
office promptly declared them the murderers, also that
they had fled to escape arrest, but neither detectives nor
police were able to locate them.</p>
<p>Nick had, however, quietly relieved the minds of
Royal&rsquo;s father and sister, confiding to them his secret, and
insuring their silence and discretion.</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s gambling-house, when his prolonged absence
seemed probable, was at once taken possession of by his
former lookout, Nathan Godard, by whom it was run as
usual for a fortnight.</p>
<p>During that time Nick quietly learned several facts.
He discovered that Godard had long occupied the adjoining
house, where he dwelt with his niece, Belle Braddon,
and a housekeeper. He learned, moreover, that Godard
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
was a greedy and unprincipled fellow, a ruffian when in
liquor, and a man generally disliked and distrusted.</p>
<p>Added to this Nick learned one very pertinent fact&mdash;that
Godard had left the faro-bank immediately after
Kendall had made his big winnings, and that he did not
return for more than an hour.</p>
<p>This was a very important point, for Nick had
reasoned that the crime must have been committed by
some person who knew that Kendall had won the money.
As the crime was committed within an hour afterward,
moreover, it obviously appeared to be the work of some
person who had seen the money won.</p>
<p>Nick put two and two together, and decided that Nate
Godard was the man he wanted. To fix the murder upon
him, however, was not an easy task.</p>
<p>Keeping his suspicions and movements well concealed,
however, Nick went at it by beginning secretly to persecute
Godard, worrying him as a cat worries a mouse.</p>
<p>At the end of two weeks he had the gambling-house
raided by the police, the furniture seized and removed,
and the house closed up.</p>
<p>Five days later he learned that Godard was secretly
dealing a faro-game in his own house, to which only a
few of his intimate and trusty friends were admitted.</p>
<p>Nick gave the police a tip, and the place was successfully
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
raided the next night, and all the paraphernalia
seized and confiscated.</p>
<p>Godard&rsquo;s feelings over these several episodes, as well
as those of his niece, Belle Braddon, appeared in their
talk at breakfast the following morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cursed if I can understand it,&rdquo; snarled Godard,
across the table. &ldquo;Twice in two weeks I have been
raided, involving the loss of several hundreds of dollars.
Worse even than that, the devil take it, my game has
been going behind at an alarming rate. Bad luck of the
worst kind appears to have struck me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard&rsquo;s face was flushed, grim, and ugly, and his
voice by no means clear. That he had been drinking was
obvious, as had been more than usually noticeable for
nearly a month. He had the look of a man with a
mental burden not easily carried, and secret apprehensions
not pleasant to endure.</p>
<p>The girl across the table, far more attractive, yet not
less evil than he, shrugged her shapely shoulders and
indulged in a low ripple of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only getting what&rsquo;s coming to you, Nate,&rdquo; she
glibly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Belle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d no business to turn such a trick as you turned.
It was too long a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! Silence, I say!&rdquo; Godard quickly snarled,
with an uglier frown. &ldquo;What need to speak of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! there&rsquo;s none here to be feared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe not, but I&rsquo;ll not have it talked about,&rdquo; declared
Godard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your share of the blunt, all you
deserve, and the least you can do is to keep your mouth
closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s closed all right, Nate, when there&rsquo;s any danger
about,&rdquo; retorted Belle pointedly. &ldquo;Have no fear of me.
I&rsquo;ll never give you away. But such tricks as that always
bring bad luck, Nate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; growled Godard, less sullenly. &ldquo;What
I can&rsquo;t understand is why the police have made such a
mark of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To raid me twice within a week&mdash;that&rsquo;s pressing
things over the limit. It&rsquo;s not usual with the infernal
bluebottles, and I&rsquo;m cursed if I can fathom it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess who has tipped them to do it?&rdquo; inquired
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Godard. &ldquo;If I could I
would put an end to these persecutions, even if I had to
turn him down to end them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put out his light, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t guess who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I wish I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can, Nate,&rdquo; declared Belle, with an unpleasant
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Godard, with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same man who had me fired out of my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Nick Carter?&rdquo; cried Godard, with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who, Nate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Nate, he either has some personal grudge
against you and me, or else he suspects&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stopped, yet stared significantly at her hearer.</p>
<p>Godard dropped his spoon and began to grow pale.
Yet the frown of his beetling brows became darker, and
the light uglier in his evil eyes. He muttered an oath
after a moment, then added, through his teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; queried Belle, with sinister significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wouldn&rsquo;t I do,&rdquo; snarled Godard, with sullen
ferocity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything that would insure wiping him
out of my path.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>The girl laughed, a coldly, cruel laugh that contrasted
vividly with the man&rsquo;s harsh voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick Carter is not an easy man to wipe out,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that as well as you, Belle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d do anything to accomplish it, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I would,&rdquo; cried Godard decisively. &ldquo;The
play would be limited to two persons, Belle, if what you
think is true. It would be him or me, and I&rsquo;m cursed if
I&rsquo;d have it me if I could help it. Why do you think of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl dried her lips and tossed aside her napkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t fancy the way things are going any
better than you do, Nate,&rdquo; she replied bitterly. &ldquo;It was
Carter who threw me out of my job at the bank, for
which he could have had no earthly reason, barring that
he suspected me of having worked Kendall for a fish
and lured him where you could shove him into a corner.
Carter doesn&rsquo;t like me for a cent, and maybe he likes
you none the less for being my uncle. Possibly he suspects
you because of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he can have no evidence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! No man ever knows what evidence Nick Carter
possesses,&rdquo; Belle curtly interrupted. &ldquo;When he gets
after a covey, about the first the poor devil knows of it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
Nate, he is down and out for keeps, with bangles on his
wrists or a hemp tie in place of a silk one. Don&rsquo;t bank
on what Nick Carter doesn&rsquo;t know. If you are up
against him, and any reason exists for his being after you,
there&rsquo;s but one safe course&mdash;and even that is a long chance
against such a man as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What course is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the bull by the horns, Nate, and either put the
detective to sleep or go under yourself in the attempt.
That&rsquo;s the only way to deal with Nick Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard sat silent for several moments, weighing in his
own mind the desperate possibility suggested. He could
not believe that he was suspected of the crime for which
the detectives and the police were searching the country
after Moses Flood and Harry Royal, yet the words of his
niece had alarmed him, and opened his eyes to the bare
possibility of a frightful peril.</p>
<p>Presently he roused himself, and stared across at the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do about it?&rdquo; he sullenly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I have said,&rdquo; replied Belle bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to turn him down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was sure that he had any designs against me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; interrupted the girl. &ldquo;There are facts you
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
shouldn&rsquo;t lose sight of, Nate. In the beginning he was
on this case in Gilsey&rsquo;s employ. Do you imagine Gilsey
has let him drop it? Not by a long chalk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; cried Belle, who was rather a clever
logician. &ldquo;Is Carter making any attempt to round up
Flood or that fool of a Royal? Not one, my word for
it. He&rsquo;s letting the central office screws scurry their legs
off on that scent. None of that for Nick Carter, mind
you. What&rsquo;s the natural conclusion, eh? Merely this&mdash;Carter
doesn&rsquo;t suspect Flood, despite the evidence. Yet
if he is still on the case, he must suspect somebody, and
that somebody may be&mdash;the right man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard&rsquo;s evil face grew darker with every word that
had fallen from the girl&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; he snarled, as she pointedly concluded.
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it in that way. By Heaven, it may
be true, as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should proceed as if it was, Nate, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to land him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can it be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to determine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as well as knocking out a half drunken fellow
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
with ninety thousand dollars in his kit, eh?&rdquo; laughed
Belle Braddon. &ldquo;I say, Nate, what would there be in it
for me if I could do the job for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn Carter down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;put out his light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own price,&rdquo; cried Godard eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In cold cash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very day it is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough for me,&rdquo; returned Belle, with a
gleeful shrug of her shoulders. &ldquo;I can use the dust all
right, Nate, and I&rsquo;ve thought of a way by which I can
do the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or get done yourself in attempting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you let me alone to look out for myself,&rdquo; sneered
Belle, with a series of significant nods. &ldquo;I cut my eye-teeth
a long time ago, and it&rsquo;s a cold day when I cannot
hoodwink a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no pipe-dream,&rdquo; growled Godard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do the job for the price mentioned, Nate&mdash;cash
on delivery,&rdquo; added the unprincipled jade. &ldquo;I must
do it at my own time and in my own way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;I care not when or how, Belle, so long as it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me to do it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you require any help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl quickly. &ldquo;When
I tackle anything of this kind, I play a lone hand. I
want no partner who some day may squeal. It&rsquo;ll be all
or nothing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could have suited Godard better, for he was
essentially a coward, and the simple thought of meeting
Nick Carter in a life or death encounter sent chills up
and down his spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall require one thing, however,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house must be vacated and all the stuff removed.
Then I must have the key of this house, also of the one
next door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flood&rsquo;s old place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a job are you cooking up?&rdquo; growled
Godard suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business, Nate,&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;I
shall do it in my own way, or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard saw that she meant it, and he had no idea of
letting her offer slip by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vacate the house this very day,&rdquo; said he promptly.
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll move our stuff down to the shore house, and open
a game there on the quiet. That will throw the cops off
my track for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you do the job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can arrange to have it come right,&rdquo; replied
Belle thoughtfully. &ldquo;Not this week, however. I
have engagements for two evenings with that yellow-haired
Dakota chap, whom I caught on to at the Waldorf
last week. He has money to burn, barrels of it, and I
must get my little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the deuce haven&rsquo;t you run him up against my
game?&rdquo; demanded Godard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never plays, Nate,&rdquo; said Belle quickly. &ldquo;I tried
it, on my word I did. But he doesn&rsquo;t know one card
from another. He says he has an uncle out West, however,
a big cattle ranchman, who is a fiend at faro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I wish he&rsquo;d wire his uncle to come on here. I
reckon we could trim him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d consent to do that, Nate,&rdquo; laughed
the girl, upon whose spirits the murderous project she
had in mind seemed to cast no cloud. &ldquo;You vacate here
to-day and give me the keys to both houses. Then leave
Nick Carter to me. Within a week I will turn him down,
or my name is not Belle Braddon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have the keys not later than Friday, Belle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s soon enough,&rdquo; nodded the girl, rising. &ldquo;Meantime,
Nate, I must devote myself to bleeding that yellow-haired
baby from Dakota. He&rsquo;s as loose as ashes with his
dust, Nate, and I&rsquo;ll give him credit for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I guess you&rsquo;ll bleed him all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t, Nate, there&rsquo;ll be something wrong with the
cards,&rdquo; said Belle, with a ringing laugh. &ldquo;So long, old
chap! I have an appointment with him at noon. A hot
bird and a cool bottle, you know, and then a ride in the
park. But you go ahead, Nate, with the moving. I&rsquo;ll
have my little job on old Nick all framed up in time,
never doubt that.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />SECRET WORK.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;m here, as I agreed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my good man, and I&rsquo;m glad to see you.
Take a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last speaker was Nick Carter.</p>
<p>The first was the whilom cuekeeper in the gambling-house
of Moses Flood&mdash;the latter&rsquo;s humpback friend,
John Green.</p>
<p>The scene was Nick Carter&rsquo;s office, on the Monday
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
afternoon following the interview between Godard and
Belle Braddon, in which the latter had contracted to turn
Nick Carter&rsquo;s toes up.</p>
<p>The interval was five days.</p>
<p>In compliance with Nick&rsquo;s genial invitation, the humpback
took a seat near the detective&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Nick, &ldquo;what has become of Godard since
he closed his up-town house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down at a shore house which he owns. Here&rsquo;s
the address, sir, and the direction for getting there. I
wrote it down, thinking you might want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick glanced at the scrawl on the slip of paper tendered
him, and bowed approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dealing a game down there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. A small one, though, only for a few
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still keeping cues for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is his assistant dealer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Bruce, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flood&rsquo;s former man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same, sir,&rdquo; nodded Green. Then he added, sadly:
&ldquo;&rsquo;Fore Heaven, sir, I&rsquo;d give all my life is worth to know
that Mr. Flood is all right, safe, and sound!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have already told you, John, that I will insure that,
providing you follow my instructions to the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll do that, Detective Carter, never doubt it!&rdquo;
cried Green eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d cut off both these hands for
Mr. Flood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; said Nick, &ldquo;what is the game doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing, sir; losing to beat the band. Godard has
dropped nearly a hundred thousand in the past month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he stand the pace long?&rdquo; inquired Nick carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sir, I&rsquo;d not have believed he could stand it till
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick already knew where Godard had probably obtained
the money mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he still drinking deeply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a fish, sir,&rdquo; grinned the humpback; &ldquo;and, holy
smoke! he&rsquo;s uglier than ten devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick laughed and nodded, evidently much pleased by
the report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dealing a square game?&rdquo; he next inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sir!&rdquo; cried Green. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Godard has
got the tools for dealing a brace game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he would do it, John, if he had the tools
and saw a good thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; and Green grimly shook his ungainly
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
head, &ldquo;I reckon Nate Godard would do anything for
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Now, John, there&rsquo;s
one thing I wish you to do for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count on me, sir, for sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Godard was to deal a brace game he would have
to tell you about it, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; so I could keep the cues right. I&rsquo;d have to
mark up the cards he took crooked, you see, or there&rsquo;d be
a holler from the players at the end of the deal, when
the cues showed wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about it, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, hark you, my man! If Godard contemplates
dealing a brace game he will first prepare the way by
giving you his instructions and secret signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, John, if he does that I want you to drop me a
letter by the very next mail saying that the trick is to be
turned. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do!&rdquo; exclaimed the humpback; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll send
the letter the minute I know of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; bowed Nick. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all to-day, John.
In leaving here be as cautious as usual. You must not
be seen, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, sir,&rdquo; smiled Green, with a shrug. &ldquo;I will
slip out and away like a shadow. You&rsquo;re sure, sir, about
poor Mr. Flood?&rdquo; he added, as he lingered for a moment
at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that, John, as I trust you,&rdquo; replied
Nick.</p>
<p>And the detective bowed and smiled pleasantly, with
a genuine appreciation of the warm and loyal heart that
beat in the crooked breast of the departing man.</p>
<p>This interview with the humpback plainly indicates the
shrewd line of work which Nick was secretly doing in
his attempt to verify the suspicious by which he was
actuated.</p>
<p>Green had been gone but a few minutes, moreover,
when a second man familiarly entered.</p>
<p>He was a stylishly clad, yellow-haired chap, with a
sandy beard, parted down the middle. He carried a cane,
sported a bright-red tie, and looked for all the world as
if he had just stepped off a fashion-plate.</p>
<p>It was the yellow-haired chap whom Belle Braddon
had boasted of having caught on to at the Waldorf.</p>
<p>Nick looked up and smiled when he entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Chick,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s now in the wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chick laughed and dropped into a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing special, Nick,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;All is working
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has no suspicions of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Chick, with a grin, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a royal
spender, I&rsquo;ll give her credit for that. She makes bank-notes
fly like dead leaves in a September gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; laughed Nick. &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em go. We&rsquo;ll
get them back from Gilsey. Besides, Chick, the situation
will not last much longer. We are closing in on
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have learned something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green has just been here and reported,&rdquo; nodded
Nick. &ldquo;Godard is located at his shore house. I know the
place and how to get there. He is dealing a game there
on the quiet, and I have several reasons for thinking that
he is nearly on his last legs, financially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case, Nick, he will take any desperate
chances to recover, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea, Chick, and it&rsquo;s what I have been
working for. Have you said anything to his niece about
the cattle-dealer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; nodded Chick. &ldquo;I have laid that wire
all right, you may wager. I showed her a telegram
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
yesterday, which I claimed to have received from my
Dakota uncle, stating that he would join me here Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her that he is coming on merely for pleasure,
and have impressed her with the idea that he is the
highest kind of a high-roller. She wanted to know if he
ever played faro, and I told her he was a regular fiend
at it, and that I had seen him sit to lose a hundred thousand
at a crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; laughed Nick. &ldquo;That certainly ought
to be strong enough. What did she say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she knew a house where he could make a
play,&rdquo; grinned Chick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! that looks promising enough,&rdquo; laughed Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her that would suit him to the letter, and that
he would be glad to give any square faro-game a play,&rdquo;
added Chick. &ldquo;She said she would fix it for us after
he arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will fix them, in return, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said
Nick grimly. &ldquo;Green is going to notify me if a brace
game is to be attempted. I&rsquo;m dead sure it will be, too,
with Godard so nearly on his uppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case, Chick, it&rsquo;s a hundred to one that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
will use Flood&rsquo;s brace deal box, and resort to the same
deck of strippers that Flood gave Kendall with the money
he had won. If we can catch Godard with that deck of
strippers in his possession, Chick, it will prove conclusively
that he murdered Kendall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He necessarily must take Green into his confidence
about the brace game,&rdquo; added Nick; &ldquo;and he will get
rid of Tom Bruce when attempting to turn the trick.
We shall probably meet nobody there but Green and
Godard, except that jade of a niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will probably take us out there, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go with her, all right,&rdquo; laughed Nick. &ldquo;You
had better fix it with her for to-morrow night, in order
that we may wind up the case as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be easy,&rdquo; nodded Chick. &ldquo;I shall find her
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will show up at the Waldorf to-morrow noon and
join you there,&rdquo; added Nick. &ldquo;I will have a roll of
money with me fit to choke a horse. Trust Godard to
venture a most desperate chance to get it. I think, Chick,
we now have the game well in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Nick,&rdquo; replied Chick, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to slip up-stairs and have a bath, then I must go back
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
to the Waldorf. I promised to dine with my friend with
the red-brown hair at six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick laughed, nodding approvingly, and Chick hastened
from the office.</p>
<p>It was then about three o&rsquo;clock. At four Nick had
business up-town, and he presently put on his street
attire and left the house.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, as he was crossing Forty-second
Street and Fifth Avenue, he was observed by a
young woman on the opposite corner.</p>
<p>The moment she saw him, moreover, a gleam of malicious
satisfaction flashed in her evil eyes.</p>
<p>She tripped quickly over the opposite crossing and
intercepted Nick as he reached the Fifth Avenue sidewalk.</p>
<p>The young woman was Belle Braddon, out for the
great detective&rsquo;s scalp.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />TRAPPED.</h2>
<p>Nick Carter suppressed any show of surprise upon beholding
Belle Braddon approaching. He halted, politely
raising his hat, upon observing that the girl intended
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
to speak to him, and they met on the Fifth Avenue
corner.</p>
<p>Belle greeted him with a smile and a pretty toss of
her well-poised head, saying glibly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-dy do, Mr. Carter? You haven&rsquo;t been round
to call on me, sir, and play that game of ping-pong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Nick, rather inclined to
laugh at her piquant audacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many invitations do you require?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can hardly say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I generally have to ask a man but once,&rdquo; pouted
Belle, with a playful shrug of her shoulders. &ldquo;I guess
you don&rsquo;t enjoy the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, Miss Braddon, ping-pong is
not my long suit,&rdquo; laughed Nick.</p>
<p>The girl joined in his laugh, saying dryly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, you really can be amusing, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when I try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try often, Detective Carter. It&rsquo;s awfully becoming.
By the way, sir, there&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;d like to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; bowed Nick; &ldquo;understand, however, that
I may not feel called upon to answer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t refuse a lady. I&rsquo;m sure you
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you feel so sure, Miss Braddon, go ahead
with your question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle drew nearer to him, and said, with a rather sinister
gleam in her lifted eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you take such pains to have me fired out
of my job at the Milmore Trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick already began to suspect her of having some
design that had not yet appeared on the surface, and
he decided to learn of what it consisted by leading her
on a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me, my dear girl,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;that
that is a needless question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why needless, my dear Mr. Carter?&rdquo; queried Belle,
in bantering tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you already know why I did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Nick. &ldquo;Think it all over and it will
probably come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did it because I told Flood about Kendall&rsquo;s
shortage, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I rather suspected it was that, Mr. Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to make sure, sir,&rdquo; laughed Belle. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s
usual reason, eh? Ah, well! have no fear, Mr. Carter;
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
I bear you no ill will for having done so. Really, I rather
like you for it, for it&rsquo;s awfully pleasant to be out of a
job,&rdquo; and the smiling jade playfully beat Nick&rsquo;s arm with
one of her gloves.</p>
<p>Then she quickly added pointedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got it in for Mr. Flood, sir, just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; queried Nick. &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he betrayed that I told you. Oh, you
wouldn&rsquo;t deny it, Mr. Carter. I know well enough that
he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never attempt to disabuse a woman who already
knows,&rdquo; laughed Nick, wondering when she would come
to the point.</p>
<p>Belle Braddon came to it, all right, in less than a
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I&rsquo;ve got in for him, Mr. Carter, and some
day I&rsquo;ll get even with him. By the way, sir, the central
office sleuths are having a fine hunt after him,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vain one, certainly,&rdquo; replied Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they hadn&rsquo;t been so hot after my Uncle Nate of
late, I&rsquo;d get even with Flood by making them wise as to
his hiding place,&rdquo; declared the girl, with affected bitterness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Then, before Nick could reply, she quickly added, as
if struck with a clever idea:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Mr. Carter! Just to show you that I
bear you no ill will, and, in fact, rather fancy you, I&rsquo;ll
throw Flood into your hands, if you&rsquo;d like to get them
on him for that murder out in Fordham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick heard her without a change of countenance. He
knew that she was absolutely ignorant of Flood&rsquo;s whereabouts,
who at that moment was in Nick&rsquo;s residence; also,
that she could have no knowledge of the latter&rsquo;s relations
with Flood.</p>
<p>Yet no man could have wanted better evidence that
the girl had some design which she was craftily plotting
to execute.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Nick at any sign of danger
to go after it, until he discovered of what it consisted.
In this case, therefore, he decided to give Belle Braddon
all the rope she wanted, or until he could learn at what
she was driving.</p>
<p>Nick was too shrewd, however, to take the bait too
greedily. Pretending to be entirely ignorant of Flood&rsquo;s
movements, he said curiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think that I wish to lay hands on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still in Gilsey&rsquo;s employ, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; I&rsquo;ll admit that I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, of course, you want Flood,&rdquo; cried Belle bluntly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of denying it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick no longer did so, it now being very obvious that
the girl had some object in view and cared not how
she accomplished it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not deny it. In fact, I really would like to
land him,&rdquo; said he, with sinister eagerness. &ldquo;Do you
mean to tell me that you know where he is located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle winked and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the level?&rdquo; demanded Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiding in a house that I know all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price will you take for the information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Belle promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can we turn the trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; said Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two conditions on which I shall insist,
however,&rdquo; added Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Namely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be governed by my directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;And let me be present when you arrest him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely want him to know that I have got even
with him,&rdquo; Belle bitterly declared, in explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dead lucky that she doesn&rsquo;t know what I know
of Flood,&rdquo; thought Nick, a little puzzled as to her game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you into the
room now occupied by Moses Flood within a quarter of
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick accompanied her, and they started up Fifth
Avenue.</p>
<p>Belle Braddon was as bold as she was crafty, and she
felt sure of landing her man single-handed.</p>
<p>The trick she was about to turn, moreover, was well
worthy of her.</p>
<p>She took Nick to Godard&rsquo;s vacant house, of which she
had the key, and they entered together.</p>
<p>Then Nick became more watchful. The empty rooms
and bare floors did not surprise him, for he knew that
Godard had moved; but there was a possibility of being
assailed by hidden foes, and Nick slipped his revolver
into his side pocket, unobserved.</p>
<p>He was, too, more than ever mystified. Knowing that
Belle Braddon could not possibly give him any clue to
Flood, he could not imagine what design existed under
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
her pretensions. He was resolved to learn, however&mdash;let
come what might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up-stairs,&rdquo; said Belle, after locking the street
door. &ldquo;This is a roundabout way, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have
done to enter Flood&rsquo;s house direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Belle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we shall find
him. He has a secret hiding-place in there. Tread
lightly on these bare floors lest the sound reaches and
alarms him. Both houses are vacant, and he should be
alone there at this hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; growled Nick quietly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into this room, Detective Carter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick followed her into one of the side chambers, and
the girl turned briefly to face him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be very quiet,&rdquo; she said softly, without the
slightest sign of nervousness or apprehension. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to let you into one of the secrets of these two
houses. As a matter of fact, Detective Carter, both of
them are owned by Moses Flood. But my uncle, who
was employed by him, has been occupying this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this room,&rdquo; continued Belle, &ldquo;there is a concealed
door, operated by pressing one of the figures in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
wall decoration. It opens into a passage leading through
another door into Flood&rsquo;s private room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick instantly recalled Flood&rsquo;s escape from Detective
Gerry, and again he nodded understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The passage was constructed,&rdquo; added Belle, &ldquo;for the
purpose of quickly getting the gambling implements out
of Flood&rsquo;s house and into this one in case of an unexpected
raid by the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door is very cleverly constructed, you observe,
so that the police could not discover it and light upon
the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see no indications of a door,&rdquo; said Nick truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; whispered Belle. &ldquo;But be quiet after
the passage is opened, for Flood might then overhear us.
He has a hiding-place in the other house and there we
shall find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle Braddon turned and pressed her hand on the
wall.</p>
<p>Instantly a heavy iron door, decorated like the wall
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
to which it was most cleverly matched, swung quickly
open.</p>
<p>A four-foot passage was revealed, brick walled on two
sides. At the farther end of it, some five feet away, a
similar iron door had swung open, and beyond it was
Flood&rsquo;s private room, which Nick immediately recalled.</p>
<p>Belle Braddon raised her finger warningly, and led
the way into the passage.</p>
<p>Nick followed her, wondering what he might expect in
the adjoining house.</p>
<p>When both were in the passage Belle turned back and
paused, whispering softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw that door after you, please! Close it quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick turned to lay his hand on the door.</p>
<p>Like a flash Belle Braddon sprang into Flood&rsquo;s private
room and dashed her hand against the side wall.</p>
<p>In an instant, before Nick could raise a finger, both
doors closed, with a loud, metallic clang and with a
rapidity indicating that they were operated by powerful
springs, which opened and closed both doors at once.</p>
<p>With a momentary thrill of dismay, Nick found himself
alone in the walled passage, and in darkness so profound
that it could almost be felt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br />THE GIRL AND THE CRIME.</h2>
<p>It was with a feeling of some chagrin that Nick Carter
realized his desperate situation the moment the heavy
iron doors of the walled passage closed upon him, leaving
him alone in the Egyptian darkness of the tomblike
place.</p>
<p>Yet the trick by which he had been caught was one
to have deceived any man. Only a clairvoyant could
have seen that the doors worked jointly and under the
motive of powerful springs.</p>
<p>Though alert and watchful from the moment he had
entered the house with Belle Braddon, he had not looked
for such a trap as this.</p>
<p>Keenly suspicious, knowing in fact that the girl was
up to some knavish game, Nick had suspected that he
was being led into Flood&rsquo;s house with a design to throw
him into the hands of several assailants, a situation which
would have given him no concern whatever, and which
he really had been inviting in order to identify the parties
to it and learn their motives.</p>
<p>Before Nick had fairly recovered from his surprise,
however, he heard the voice of Belle Braddon from
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
Flood&rsquo;s private room. It sounded dead and muffled,
much as if Nick was locked in a bank vault, yet he
could readily distinguish her words and the triumphant
intonation with which they were uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Carter,&rdquo; she cried, crouching to place her lips
near the crack of the closed door, &ldquo;are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick instantly resumed his usual composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he coolly answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw me out of a job, will you?&rdquo; screamed the
girl, with a ringing laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do more than that for you one of these days,
young lady,&rdquo; Nick cried back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will!&rdquo; returned Belle derisively. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
be many days before there&rsquo;ll be singing and flowers at
your house, and you&rsquo;ll ride at the head of a procession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not hear any of the music, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bank too heavily on that,&rdquo; replied Nick. &ldquo;I
have been in worse places than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And got out alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And got out alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you get out of this one, Carter, you&rsquo;ll be a
bird,&rdquo; cried Belle tauntingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that this is
no gilded cage. How do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s snug and cozy all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to enjoy it. I&rsquo;m going to
leave you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; retorted Nick. &ldquo;Your room
is preferable to your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; laughed Belle. &ldquo;The sentiment is mutual.
By the way, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may make all the noise you wish. It won&rsquo;t disturb
anybody, for there&rsquo;s nobody to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to know that,&rdquo; cried Nick, undaunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both houses are vacant and you are midway between
them,&rdquo; cried Belle, with a cruel laugh. &ldquo;You may yell
your lungs out and you&rsquo;ll not be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall keep my lungs where they belong,&rdquo; cried
Nick, a bit impatiently. &ldquo;I shall require my voice a
little later, to testify against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk that, my man,&rdquo; retorted the girl. &ldquo;In that
trap you&rsquo;ll not live more than a day or two. If you don&rsquo;t
suffocate you&rsquo;ll starve, for nobody will show up here
for many a day. I&rsquo;ll insure that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. It&rsquo;s very kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re entirely welcome,&rdquo; answered Belle. &ldquo;And
when your body is finally discovered here, it will be assumed
that you came here alone in search of Flood and
accidentally got caught between the iron doors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite reasonable, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very clever, isn&rsquo;t it? You see, Carter, no one will
ever be suspected of having lured you here and lodged
you in there. You are reputed to be too clever to be
caught in a trap in that fashion. It&rsquo;s dead open and
shut that your death will be attributed to an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providing I die here,&rdquo; supplemented Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;ll be something wrong with the
deck,&rdquo; cried Belle, with derisive assurance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
to your funeral, Carter, and send a broken column.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough. I&rsquo;d prefer gates ajar, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doors ajar, you mean,&rdquo; cried Belle, with a scream
of laughter. &ldquo;Good-by, Carter. I&rsquo;m going to leave you
now. I have a date at the Waldorf at six. I&rsquo;m going
to dine with a yellow-haired chappie from Dakota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by&mdash;and good riddance,&rdquo; cried Nick.</p>
<p>The last brought no answer.</p>
<p>Belle Braddon had glided silently out of Flood&rsquo;s private
room and was hurrying down the hall stairs.</p>
<p>Despite her derisive laughter and the taunting remarks
with which she had mocked her helpless victim,
her cheeks were as white as the knot of lace on her
heaving breast.</p>
<p>The awful horror of the crime she had committed was
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
upon her. She fully believed that she had left Nick
Carter to suffocate in the foul atmosphere of the walled
passage; or, if spared that fate, that thirst and starvation
would overcome him.</p>
<p>The very hideousness of the crime shook even her callous
nature and filled her quaking soul with nameless
horror.</p>
<p>The nervous tremor of her feet on the uncarpeted
stairs as she hurriedly descended thrilled her with alarm,
and her knees were knocking together when she reached
the lower hall.</p>
<p>There she paused and caught her breath, steadying
herself, then went into one of the silent parlors, as silent
as death itself, to peer through the closed blinds into
the sunlit street.</p>
<p>The brighter light outside restored her nerve, and a
smile of vengeful exultation relaxed her drawn gray
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as good as done for, as good as done for,&rdquo; she
muttered through her teeth. &ldquo;It serves him right. It
was his life or that of my uncle, and all is fair when
life hangs in the balance. He would have turned Nate
down as indifferently as he did me, and he has invited
only what he has got. Let him take his medicine, then!
It&rsquo;s what he deserves!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>With such reasoning as this she put the horrid crime
out of her mind, and resolved to think no more about it.</p>
<p>With calmness came greater cunning. She reasoned
that she might be seen leaving Flood&rsquo;s house, if she
departed by the front door. Instead, she descended
to the basement.</p>
<p>There she broke a window and opened the catch, to
indicate that Nick Carter, when his lifeless remains
should be discovered, had entered the house, presumably
in search of Moses Flood. That he had accidentally
been caught in the walled passage she also felt sure would
be assumed. That the crime should never be brought
home to her, she was taking every precaution.</p>
<p>In the semidarkness of the basement, she next tied a
thick veil over her hat, and drew it carefully about her
face.</p>
<p>Then she let herself out the back door, locking it
after her, and stole quickly through a narrow alley, and
thus gained the nearest side street.</p>
<p>Now she breathed freely again, and triumphantly hastened
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand easily earned&mdash;easily earned!&rdquo; she said
to herself, weighing in mind the price Nathan Godard
had agreed to pay for Nick Carter&rsquo;s life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>Belle Braddon dined that evening with her yellow-haired
chance acquaintance from Dakota, so alleged.</p>
<p>Had she dreamed for an instant that she was dining
with Chick Carter, she would have fallen out of her
chair in a fit.</p>
<p>It was midnight when she reached home at the shore
house of Nathan Godard, and she found the large wooden
dwelling enveloped in darkness.</p>
<p>There was no game in progress that night.</p>
<p>Belle went straight to bed&mdash;as straight as her unsteady
steps would take her, and slept soundly until morning,
the heavy sleep of semi-intoxication.</p>
<p>At breakfast with Nate Godard that morning she gave
him the key to the situation&mdash;but not the situation itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep away from those two town houses, Nate,&rdquo;
she said grimly to him, over her coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; inquired Godard curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what it&rsquo;s for,&rdquo; replied the girl, with
threatening significance. &ldquo;You do just as I say; that
was the agreement when I undertook to accomplish this
Carter job for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard started slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it done?&rdquo; he quickly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as done, make no mistake about that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the level?&rdquo; cried Godard, with knavish eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, on the level,&rdquo; declared Belle. &ldquo;But, mark what
I say, Nate, and this goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep away from those two town houses for the
next ten days. If you don&rsquo;t do so, Nate Godard, you
later may be run down to police headquarters, in Mulberry
Street, to answer to the worst charge in the calendar.
So do what I command, or bitter trouble may be
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his mind&rsquo;s eye, so pointed were the girl&rsquo;s remarks,
Nate Godard fairly could see the lifeless body of Nick
Carter stretched upon the cellar floor of one of the two
houses. How Belle Braddon had accomplished it Godard
neither knew nor cared. He felt it would be a safe
gamble to follow her instructions to the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thunder! Belle, I believe you have brought a shift
of luck,&rdquo; he exclaimed, after a moment, with a grim
mingling of satisfaction and approval. &ldquo;On my word,
Belle, you are one girl in a million!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, then drained her cup of
coffee to its dregs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have another bit of
news for you, too, Nate!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Dakota chap&rsquo;s uncle is coming on here to join his
nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil you say!&rdquo; cried Godard, half rising from his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joke, Nate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is he coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to meet the two of them at the Waldorf to-morrow
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the wealthy cattle-dealer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same, Nate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he be induced to go up against my game here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle Braddon&rsquo;s crafty eyes took on a quizzical look
at the man opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he can, Nate?&rdquo; she answered slowly: &ldquo;could
you make a sure thing of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much can be won?&rdquo; demanded Godard ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred thousand, at the least, if you get him on
the down track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he comes from Dakota?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt of it, Nate, not a shadow of doubt.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
cried Belle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the telegram he sent to his
nephew, and that simple guy hasn&rsquo;t art enough to deceive
an old woman. Yes, Nate, it&rsquo;s dead open and shut that
the uncle comes from Dakota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard dropped back into his chair and fell to thinking.</p>
<p>He was thinking of Moses Flood&rsquo;s brace deal box,
then in his own possession.</p>
<p>He was thinking, too, of a deck of strippers, also in
his possession, with which he could vary to his own advantage
the turn of every card.</p>
<p>In the lives of those who pursue fickle fortune through
the medium of games of chance there is no experience
which so arouses a spirit of utter recklessness as that
of protracted losing. Sooner or later it drives discretion
from its seat and opens the door for hot-headed desperation.</p>
<p>Say why the moth flies madly into the flame that consumes
him! Say why the screaming sea-gull dashes out
his brains against the dazzling windows of the towering
lighthouse! Say why the undetected murderer haunts
the neighborhood of his bloody crime!</p>
<p>Give answer to these questions&mdash;and then you may say
what frenzy of human nature led Nathan Godard to
dare self-destruction in the passionate greed of an evil
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Presently he looked up, fixing his inflamed eyes upon
Belle Braddon&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sure thing?&rdquo; said he hoarsely. &ldquo;Yes, I can make it
a sure thing, Belle, that we win his money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No slip-up, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Belle approvingly. &ldquo;Get rid of all but
your cuekeeper, Nate, and notify the gang that there&rsquo;ll
be no game here to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Belle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have the Dakota couple here at precisely nine
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br />CLOSING IN.</h2>
<p>Nick Carter did not long remain idle after Belle Braddon
left him alone in the trap she had sprung on him
and made her departure from Flood&rsquo;s vacant house.</p>
<p>Nick kept quiet only until he felt sure she had gone,
and then he began to take the precise measure of his
situation.</p>
<p>With both houses vacant, and the walled passage midway
between them, there was, as Belle Braddon had
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
said, no possibility that he could make himself heard by
persons in the adjoining dwellings or upon the street.</p>
<p>Nick gave up that idea almost at the outset.</p>
<p>That help would come to him seemed equally improbable.
Nick knew that Flood would not visit his
house and that Belle Braddon would insure that no person
entered the one adjoining. That any accidental
intruder would put in an appearance was next to absurd.</p>
<p>Nick quickly dropped all hope of relief of that character;
in fact, nearly as quickly as he had dropped the
other.</p>
<p>This left him but one resource&mdash;himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in here, and I must get out,&rdquo; he grimly said to
himself. &ldquo;I was fool enough to be caught in the trap,
but I&rsquo;ll try to be clever enough to get out of it. First
of all, to investigate it, for which we&rsquo;ll have a little
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick never went without the ordinary requirements of
his vocation, and he quickly fished out of his pocket a
small electric lamp, the current of which he turned on,
and immediately a flood of light dispelled the intense
darkness of his narrow quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that is more like it,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Now to
look about a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>A careful examination of the place required but a
little time.</p>
<p>On two sides were the bare brick walls of the passage,
reaching from the floor to the ceiling.</p>
<p>At each end was the inner surface of a heavy iron
door, which was as tightly closed as that of a steel safe.
Under all the pressure Nick possibly could bring to bear
upon them they were not even jarred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um! There&rsquo;s no opening them by force, that&rsquo;s sure!&rdquo;
he presently decided. &ldquo;Sheet-iron, too, over stout wood,
no doubt, and securely riveted. To break through them
is also out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! It&rsquo;s getting close in here already. I shall
need fresh air before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ceiling was two feet above his head, and brief
study convinced Nick that nothing could be done in that
direction.</p>
<p>Next he sounded the walls and doors with the butt of
his revolver. Each appeared to be solid, infernally solid,
and Nick then fell to his knees upon the bare floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way,&rdquo; he muttered decisively. &ldquo;I must
get through this floor in some way. It must be done
quickly, too, or I may become weak for want of better
air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Upon his hands and knees Nick carefully examined the
floor.</p>
<p>It consisted of spruce boards, six inches wide, in most
of which there was no break. Presently, however, he
discovered a crack where the ends of two of the boards
met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! this is better!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>With his knife he dug out the wood around the nails
securing the longer of the two boards, and succeeded in
slightly prying up the end of it.</p>
<p>There was another board beneath it.</p>
<p>With countenance grown more grim and determined,
Nick rose to his feet and drew his revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long chance,&rdquo; he growled, under his breath.
&ldquo;The smoke will make it closer than ever in here, but I
must know what&rsquo;s under these boards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He aimed down at a spot a few inches from the end
of the one he had started, then fired.</p>
<p>The report almost deafened him, and a cloud of smoke
immediately filled the place.</p>
<p>The bullet tore through the floor, splitting the end of
the upper board, then plowed its way down through the
frescoed ceiling of the room below.</p>
<p>Nick dropped to his knees again, and peered down
through the hole left by the chunk of lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>As he did so a breath of fresh air filled his nostrils,
and he could discern daylight below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eureka! I&rsquo;m over one of the rooms!&rdquo; he cried to
himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fool that sly jade yet&mdash;and that isn&rsquo;t all
I will do for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick now went to work with a will. With his knife
he pried up the splintered end of the board until he could
get his fingers under it. Then he ripped up a section of
it, as if it had been so much cardboard.</p>
<p>To remove the remaining pieces of the upper board required
about five minutes, and Nick then tackled the one
below it.</p>
<p>First, he fired a second bullet, making a hole a few
inches from the former. With his knife he then hacked
out the wood between the two holes, thus enabling him
to get a good grip upon the board. With his boot heel,
and at times with the butt of his revolver, he split the
plank in several places, and at the end of fifteen minutes
he had the lower board ripped out.</p>
<p>Though reeking from every pore, Nick at once thrust
his leg through the aperture and down between the
beams, and with his heel broke through the laths and
plastering of the ceiling below.</p>
<p>That he could now effect his escape he had not the
least doubt; yet it required time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Nearly two hours of hard labor followed before he
could hack a hole in the floor sufficiently large for
him to pass through, and it was six o&rsquo;clock before the
work was done.</p>
<p>Then Nick pocketed his knife and lamp, wormed
himself through the opening, and dropped into the room
below.</p>
<p>He found himself in the house lately occupied by
Nathan Godard.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Nick went to the basement and found
an old broom, and with it removed all of the rubbish
that had fallen to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case that jade comes here before to-morrow night,
to learn if I have survived, I&rsquo;ll have this stuff out of
her way, and chance that she does not observe the ceiling,&rdquo;
he said to himself. &ldquo;Even if she gets no sound
from that trap up there, she&rsquo;ll not dare open the door.
To make sure of her movements, however, and that the
trick for to-morrow night is by no means queered, I will
have Patsy shadow these two houses all day to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly dark when Nick arrived home, and he sat
up until midnight waiting for Chick to return.</p>
<p>The latter had left Belle Braddon less than an hour
before, and she had been with Chick since six o&rsquo;clock
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
that evening, so Nick knew that she had not returned
to Flood&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Chick, moreover, had craftily planned with Belle to
visit Godard&rsquo;s shore house the following night, taking
with them the alleged uncle who was to arrive from
Dakota.</p>
<p>Naturally, the uncle was Nick Carter, and the two detectives
were to meet Belle Braddon at the Waldorf the
following afternoon.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock next morning Nick received a telegram
from Green. It contained only two words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick laughed exultingly when he read it, and passed
it to Chick, the two being seated in Nick&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does settle it,&rdquo; declared the latter. &ldquo;Godard is
expecting us, and has given the humpback instructions
about the cues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; cried Chick. &ldquo;Belle Braddon has fallen
into the net I have spread for her, and Godard expects
to find an easy mark in my cattle-raising uncle from
Dakota.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Godard who will be the easy mark!&rdquo; Nick grimly
rejoined. &ldquo;One thing is sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;Belle Braddon will never dream that your uncle is
Nick Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly,&rdquo; laughed Chick. &ldquo;She is probably dead
sure that you are down and out by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have Patsy shadowing both houses, in case she goes
there. That is not likely, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Chick. &ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t fancy dead
bodies, and shrink from going where they are. Yet she&rsquo;s
about as bad a trickster in petticoats as I ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell the encouraging news to Flood and
Harry Royal,&rdquo; said Nick. &ldquo;Then we will get ourselves
in shape for the round-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon that day the yellow-haired chap, who had
been at the Waldorf for nearly ten days, appeared at
the famous hotel with a companion&mdash;his uncle.</p>
<p>No man, however suspicious, would have recognized
Nick in the disguise he then wore.</p>
<p>His face was stained to a hue acquired only by long
exposure to the burning sun of the plains. His hair
was coarse and black, and a heavy beard concealed the
lower portion of his face. Two of his teeth had been
&ldquo;stopped out,&rdquo; which, when he laughed, gave his mouth
a peculiarly repulsive look. His hands gave evidence
of much labor, and his figure was rounded at the shoulders
and several inches below its normal height. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
was clad in a suit characteristic of the part he had assumed,
and presented, indeed, a most striking picture.</p>
<p>Precisely at six o&rsquo;clock, Belle Braddon, arrayed in
the height of fashion, arrived in a carriage at the hotel,
where Chick received her and took her to his suite of
rooms.</p>
<p>He had already cautioned her against appearing to be
greatly amused by the oddities and roughness of the
Western ranchman; yet when Belle Braddon met Nick
and was introduced to him she scarcely could contain
herself. She thought for sure that she was up against
a genuine Western &ldquo;Rube.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sonorous bass laugh came from Nick when they
were introduced, to which was boisterously added, with a
familiarity that tickled the girl immensely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the gal my Archie&rsquo;s run up agin&rsquo;, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am, sir,&rdquo; Belle admitted, blushing with affected
demureness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, to tell the hull truth, Miss Braddon, I&rsquo;m durned
if I don&rsquo;t ruther envy him,&rdquo; declared Nick, with blunt
heartiness.</p>
<p>The girl laughed, shrugging her shoulders, and appearing
greatly flattered, then laid off her wrap to wait
for dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>It was six o&rsquo;clock before the meal was served, and
Nick dined and wined the party liberally.</p>
<p>During the progress of the dinner, which was served
in one of the elaborate private dining-rooms, the project
of going out to Godard&rsquo;s shore house was brought up,
and Nick expressed his readiness to give the game a
good, handsome play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got money enough&mdash;barrels of it,&rdquo; he declared to
Belle, much to her delight. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s meat and drink
fur me, lass, to get up agin&rsquo; a layout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall be accommodated,&rdquo; laughed Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll not forget, gal, &rsquo;twas you who put us wise
to the fun,&rdquo; added Nick pointedly.</p>
<p>This looked to Belle Braddon like the promise of a
reward, and she slyly pressed Nick&rsquo;s hand under the
table.</p>
<p>She received the reward all right&mdash;or, at least, what
was coming to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br />THE RIGHT MAN.</h2>
<p>It was precisely nine o&rsquo;clock when Nick Carter, Chick,
and Belle Braddon arrived at Godard&rsquo;s shore house, to
which they were admitted by the humpback and conducted
into the dining-room.</p>
<p>Nate Godard appeared pale and somewhat intoxicated
when he received them, but his nerve quickly returned
after the introductions and the hearty responses of his
visitors, and he promptly invited them to the sideboard
to have a drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your very good health, Mr. Hedge,&rdquo; said he,
addressing Nick by the name he had assumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours, too, sir,&rdquo; cried Nick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are fond of bucking the tiger, are you, and
have come out here to give my game a little play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond of it&rsquo;s no name for it, neighbor,&rdquo; declared Nick,
as he drained his glass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit off color just now,
though, for I haven&rsquo;t set down before a stack o&rsquo; checks
for nigh a year. All the more saved up for you to win,
eh?&rdquo; he added, with a boisterous display of good humor.
&ldquo;That ere&rsquo;s one way o&rsquo; looking at it, Mr. Godard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard joined in Nick&rsquo;s loud laugh, and Belle Braddon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
who was now making up to Nick with an eye to
the future, playfully twined his arm with her hand and
cried gleefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re really too funny, Mr. Hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet so, lass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me laugh nearly every time you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, as long as I don&rsquo;t make you cry, my dear gal,
there&rsquo;s no sleep to be lost, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a wink, sir,&rdquo; Belle rejoined, with a seductive
glance and smile.</p>
<p>A very little of such banter as this went a long way
with Nick when more serious business was pressing, and
he presently asked roundly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your game, Mr. Godard? Let&rsquo;s have a look
at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk and play at the same time, you know,&rdquo;
put in Chick agreeably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t do any playing, my boy,&rdquo; roared Nick
good-naturedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough fur one o&rsquo; the Hedge
family to be up agin&rsquo; the tiger. You don&rsquo;t set down a
chip&mdash;mind that, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can look on, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; grumbled Chick.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm in that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you can look on, lad. There&rsquo;s no chance to lose
in looking on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come up-stairs, Mr. Hedge,&rdquo; said Godard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, too,&rdquo; declared Belle, as he led the way.
&ldquo;I want to see how you Westerners go at the game, Mr.
Hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go at it, gal, like a bull at a gate,&rdquo; Nick loudly
laughed, slipping his arm around her as they mounted
the stairs.</p>
<p>Green already had the room brightly lighted, yet he
gave no sign of ever having seen the visitors.</p>
<p>The faro-room was, barring the elaborate furnishings
at Flood&rsquo;s, not unlike that previously described, and a
sonorous laugh broke from Nick Carter when he beheld
the layout on the table and saw the preparations which
had been made for the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, she does have a durned natural look, Godard,&rdquo;
he cried, in stentorian tones. &ldquo;How much can I sit to
win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your expenses, at least,&rdquo; Godard significantly replied,
joining in the other&rsquo;s laugh.</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s expressive eyes evinced just the least bit of
disappointment when he perceived the pack of cards laid
carelessly on a chair at one side of the table, but when
Nathan Godard took his seat back of the layout, and then
produced a pack from behind the check-rack, a momentary
blaze fired their somber depths, only to wane
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
again to a steady glow like that of burning coals through
the darkness.</p>
<p>Nick recognized the deck of cards at a glance.</p>
<p>It was the same deck of strippers with which Moses
Flood had dealt himself a loser and afterward strapped
in the satchel with the money he had paid to Cecil Kendall,
less than one hour before the latter was murdered
in the rectory grounds.</p>
<p>They were very positive evidence of Nathan Godard&rsquo;s
guilt, yet Nick knew that there were other cards like
them, and foresaw that even further proof was desirable.
A profound reader of human nature, as well as a man
of tremendous mental force, Nick was planning to drive
the wretch opposite to a frenzy of excitement when, at
the proper time, he could evoke from him an involuntary
yet absolute self-betrayal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My expenses, eh?&rdquo; he boisterously replied, turning
to wink at Belle, then at the humpback cuekeeper, who
had taken his seat at the end of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, sir, if you get &rsquo;em down right,&rdquo; laughed
Godard, a bit nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, my expenses will be suthing,&rdquo; roared Nick, &ldquo;if
we blow in the stuff as we did at the Waldorf. Gee whiz!
but it costs suthing to eat and liquor up in that &rsquo;ere
tavern. Eh, Archie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, old man,&rdquo; nodded Chick, who was
seated near-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in with my play, lass, or with Godard&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
cried Nick, turning to Belle with a great display of
joviality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always in with the winner,&rdquo; replied the girl, with
a ringing laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho, that&rsquo;s it, eh? Cunning as a kitten, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always looking out for my own interest,&rdquo; grinned
Belle, patting Nick&rsquo;s cheek from behind his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, gal,&rdquo; cried Nick approvingly. &ldquo;Waal,
Mr. Godard, across the crick thar, give me a stack o&rsquo;
chips. I&rsquo;ll show you how we play the bank on the t&rsquo;other
side o&rsquo; the Mississip. I dropped seven thousand in hides
in Chicago, on my way here, the which I&rsquo;m out to get
back. Ha, ha! in with the winner, lass, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While boisterously voicing the above, Nick drew from
the side pocket of his coat a huge roll of bank-notes, from
which he quickly stripped off two of five hundred dollars
each, and carelessly tossed them across the layout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme a stack o&rsquo; chips!&rdquo; he cried noisily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One stack?&rdquo; queried Godard, startled by the prospect
of so big a game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;One stack&mdash;sartin!&rdquo; cried Nick. &ldquo;Fifty dollars a chip,
that&rsquo;s good enough fur me. Same as plug ante, what we
used to play in &rsquo;49 under the wagon-trains. What&rsquo;s the
limit, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard began to tremble under this show of utter recklessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may stack them up until I call you down,&rdquo; said
he, speaking calmly with an effort.</p>
<p>Yet he did not feel easy. It is no small undertaking
to deal brace faro, even under ordinary conditions; and
to Godard these appeared without precedent.</p>
<p>His evil heart was beating like a trip-hammer. His
blood was rushing like fire through his veins. Yet the
sight of the pretended cattle-dealer&rsquo;s money served to
nerve him for a time, and with jaws fixed he began to
shuffle the deck of strippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till you call me down, eh?&rdquo; roared Nick, as if in
great enjoyment. &ldquo;That ought to be good enough, and
it&rsquo;s what I like to hear. No piking around fur me, a chip
a rip. They say it&rsquo;s good luck to stake a cuss afore beginning,
so take that, my bucko, and put it in your kit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir!&rdquo; cried the humpback, as Nick tossed
him a chip valued at fifty dollars.</p>
<p>Nick nodded and laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sort of a cross atween a man and monkey,
ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; he jokingly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;ll not take any blue ribbons for my
beauty,&rdquo; rejoined Green, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; roared Nick. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, my lad!
All ready, eh? What&rsquo;s to the top o&rsquo; the box&mdash;an eight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite his show of carelessness, Nick had seen the
cards shuffled, stripped, and butted. He knew to a certainty
how to place his money. He divided his stack of
chips and coppered two winners for the entire lot.</p>
<p>Godard felt a thrill of exultation.</p>
<p>Nick had set his money down to lose.</p>
<p>The miscreant opposite was not forced to take a false
card in order to win, and he felt relieved.</p>
<p>The first turn from the box brought a decision&mdash;the
pretended dealer in cattle had lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho!&rdquo; he cried, with a quick flash of his eyes.
&ldquo;Can you do thet, ag&rsquo;in? Let&rsquo;s see you do thet ag&rsquo;in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godard&rsquo;s only reply was to send out another turn
from the deal box.</p>
<p>But Nick&rsquo;s question was answered&mdash;he had lost again,
just as he had planned.</p>
<p>Now he did not laugh. He jerked his chair quickly
nearer the table, and ferociously yanked out his roll of
money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme two stacks this time!&rdquo; he cried aggressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two goes, mister,&rdquo; nodded Godard.</p>
<p>He raked in the bank-notes cast upon the layout, and
set forth their equivalent in chips.</p>
<p>Yet he did not speak again, to add to his husky remark.
He dared not trust his voice. It was nothing
short of robbery, this that he was doing, and he felt
that he could see his finish if he got caught cheating.</p>
<p>Nick looked and acted like a man who would fairly
eat another, under such a provocation.</p>
<p>Then Nick went down upon the layout with every
chip that he had bought.</p>
<p>This time he bet to win, thus forcing Godard to take
a false card.</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s object was to drive the man to a frenzy of excitement,
when discretion would be overwhelmed, and
then bring a climax that would evoke self-betrayal.</p>
<p>Godard took the false card, made a secret sign, and a
quick responsive rap sounded from his cuekeeper.</p>
<p>Yet he was ghastly to the lips when he glanced at
Nick to see if the deception had been detected.</p>
<p>Nick saw it all right, but his countenance did not
change. He saw, too, that Godard was beginning to
work under the highest kind of pressure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>The latter raked in a thousand dollars on the turn,
and the magnitude of the possibility before him alone
enabled him to maintain his nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I win a bet?&rdquo; Nick hoarsely cried, after buying
for the third time and losing. &ldquo;Curse the infernal luck&mdash;can&rsquo;t
I win a bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are really getting them down a bit unlucky,
uncle,&rdquo; observed Chick, with pretended sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is, dear man,&rdquo; said Belle, in persuasive tones.</p>
<p>They now appeared to be wasted upon the irate cattle-dealer,
however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme some more chips, Godard,&rdquo; he fiercely
growled, slinging a fifth thousand dollars over the layout.
&ldquo;Gimme some more chips, I say! What sort of a dealer
hev I been steered up agin&rsquo;, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deal is all right, sir,&rdquo; stammered Godard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t? I said dealer!&rdquo; snarled Nick
ferociously.</p>
<p>Godard&rsquo;s hand shook visibly as he shoved the desired
stacks of chips toward Nick. The strain upon him was
something frightful, and his brain felt as if seared with
a terrible heat. The gravity of the situation seemed to
steadily increase, and fear of what might occur was
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
taking ugly hold upon him. He ground his teeth together,
and nerved himself to finish the deal.</p>
<p>From the top of the box to the bottom Nick did not
win a bet.</p>
<p>He started the second deal ten thousand dollars loser,
and Godard was trembling in his chair.</p>
<p>The second deal was about like the first.</p>
<p>Nick played to lose. He coppered the winning cards,
and played the losers to win. Time and time again he
forced himself to call for more chips, and each time
noticed that Godard was becoming more and more beside
himself. The perspiration stood in great drops on
the latter&rsquo;s face, and the arteries of his neck and brow
were pulsing violently. Nick saw that he had him nearly
where he wanted him.</p>
<p>Even Belle Braddon was gazing with affrighted eyes
upon the dreadful scene, hushed and pale now, with
her hands pressed above her heart.</p>
<p>Chick saw by the look in Nick&rsquo;s eyes that the climax
was approaching, and he quietly made ready for it.</p>
<p>Half-a-minute later Nick drove the knife deeper into
his victim.</p>
<p>The deal had come down to two turns only, and Nick
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
knew the cues were wrong and that Godard must take
a card to right them.</p>
<p>Nick forced Godard to win by stealing, and the latter&rsquo;s
hand shook as if with palsy as he did it.</p>
<p>A rap from the cuekeeper followed, and then the
announcement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick resolved it should be the very last.</p>
<p>He placed his bet&mdash;and purposely lost!</p>
<p>Then he uttered a terrible cry, as if thrilled with sudden
suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the cues right? Be the cues right?&rdquo; he roared,
glaring fiercely at the startled humpback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then lemme see them cards!&rdquo; yelled Nick, with his
swarthy face awfully distorted and his eyes blazing like
fire. &ldquo;Lemme see the cards. I say! &mdash;&mdash; you, Godard,
there&rsquo;s suthing wrong with them cards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The humpback leaped to his feet with a hoarse remonstrance,
and while Nathan Godard, ghastly as a
corpse, covered the cards with his left hand, his right
went to his hip pocket.</p>
<p>It was the very move Nick wanted to see him make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme see &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he roared furiously, half rising
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
from his chair. &ldquo;I tell you there&rsquo;s suthing wrong with
them cards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme see &rsquo;em! Lemme see &rsquo;em, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him see them, Nate!&rdquo; shrieked Belle Braddon,
wild lest Godard&rsquo;s frightful agitation should betray him.</p>
<p>Nick reached across the layout with a terrible imprecation,
and snatched the pack of cards from under Godard&rsquo;s
quivering hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s blood on them!&rdquo; he roared fiercely, with his
eyes fixed on those of the shaking man opposite. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
blood on them! The blood of a man killed for money&mdash;killed
for gain, and by you who now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick got no further.</p>
<p>The thrilling accusation was more than Nate Godard,
in his unnerved condition, could sustain. He saw the
scheme by which he was being duped&mdash;and he saw again
the staring corpse that he had left behind him in the
rectory grounds in Fordham.</p>
<p>With a single wild cry, most like a shriek, he leaped to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; he yelled; &ldquo;I know you now! You&rsquo;re
Moses Flood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; thundered Nick, tearing off his disguise.
&ldquo;I am Nick Carter, the detective!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Belle Braddon uttered a scream that pierced the very
walls of the house, and from somewhere under her skirts
snatched out a revolver.</p>
<p>Chick Carter, with eyes alert to see where he was most
needed, was upon her as a leopard leaps upon a hare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life, miss!&rdquo; he cried, wrenching away
the weapon and forcing her into a chair.</p>
<p>Nate Godard, too, had drawn his revolver, but he never
again discharged it.</p>
<p>Nick swept across the table like a whirlwind, and in
an instant had the desperate man by the throat.</p>
<p>Then he drew back, startled.</p>
<p>Godard&rsquo;s grip on his revolver had relaxed, and the
weapon fell clattering to the floor. He threw both hands
above his head, like one stricken a fatal blow, then
brought both palms violently to his skull, as if within
were the seat of a dreadful pain. His distorted face
suddenly grew ghastly, with lips drawn and eyes rolling,
and but for Nick Carter&rsquo;s supporting arm he would have
fallen headlong to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done for!&rdquo; cried Nick to Chick, over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Nick was right: one glance at the man&rsquo;s death-swept
face was enough.</p>
<p>In the awful stress of his horror, terror, and excitement,
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
Nathan Godard had ruptured an artery of his
brain.</p>
<p>The rest, involving the subsequent fortunes of those
who have figured in these pages, may be briefly and
simply told.</p>
<p>Godard died within an hour, without regaining consciousness,
and thus cheated human justice, only to meet
at a divine tribunal the punishment he deserved.</p>
<p>From Belle Braddon, however, whom fear of punishment
now drove to a confession, the facts were obtained
that fully established Godard&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
<p>He had left the faro-bank just after seeing Kendall
win the ninety thousand dollars, and when the latter
emerged Godard shadowed him to Fordham.</p>
<p>As Nick Carter had shrewdly reasoned, Kendall went
to peer through the library window before entering the
rectory. Godard, meantime, had seen Flood arrive and
hitch his team at the rear gate, putting his heavy cane in
the body of the buggy.</p>
<p>Flood, however, wishing to see Dora Royal alone, had
not gone directly to that side of the house on which the
crime was committed, but had passed slowly around it,
in the hope of attracting her attention from one of the
windows.</p>
<p>Godard, meantime, secured Flood&rsquo;s cane, waylaid and
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
killed Kendall, then made off with the satchel of money,
afterward concealing the cane in the brushwood, that
the crime might be charged to Flood.</p>
<p>The latter, upon coming around the house, had seen
only Harry Royal, with the results already set forth.</p>
<p>Belle Braddon did not for her confession, however,
escape punishment for her evil doings. Nick promptly
placed her under arrest, as an accessory after the crime,
as well as for the attempt upon his life, and she ultimately
received her just deserts.</p>
<p>When the heroic part that Moses Flood had played in
behalf of the Royals was fully made known to the rector,
he did precisely what Nick Carter anticipated. Upon
Flood&rsquo;s renunciation of his business, which had been entirely
voluntary, Doctor Royal forgave the past and accepted
him as his daughter&rsquo;s suitor.</p>
<p>Flood went abroad for six months, returning as the
American representative of one of the largest silk concerns
in France, and he and Dora Royal were married
that year, establishing themselves in a fine West End
Avenue residence. The two houses, which were sad
reminders of his past, Flood sold to the best advantage,
and gave the entire proceeds to charity.</p>
<p>The love and gratitude of the happy couple for Nick
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
Carter may be easily imagined, and both were numbered
among Nick&rsquo;s dearest friends.</p>
<p>The great detective frequently said of Flood in after
years, when recalling the incidents here depicted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly was the prince of gamesters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And certainly it seems to be a good safe wager that
Nick Carter, as usual, was entirely right.</p>

<p>This line has become famous for its excellent stories of the
detection of crime. Of late, it has taken truly remarkable strides
in the public&rsquo;s favor. The reason for this is that every book
is a marvel of its kind. They are high-class tales, not of the
&ldquo;blood-and-thunder&rdquo; order, but with plausible plots which hold
the reader fairly captivated with breathless expectation. Among
these are the stories of the adventures of Nick Carter and his
clever assistants; of &ldquo;Old Spicer,&rdquo; the clever private detective,
whose exploits are among the most remarkable ever performed
by any detective. If you are in search of good, interesting
matter, a decided change from that to which you have been
accustomed, purchase a few of these titles. They will not only
please and interest you, but will give you a clear insight into
the methods of the various classes of criminals.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
